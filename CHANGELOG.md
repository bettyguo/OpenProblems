# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once a public release is cut. Pre-release work is tracked under `[Unreleased]` and grouped by Phase / Unit per `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §12.

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 0 — Foundation

#### Unit 0.0 — Repo bootstrap

- Added `README.md` (project intro + reading order for contributors).
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Added `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` seeded with Q1–Q9 from `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §17 and Q10–Q13 surfaced during the Unit 0.0 THINK stage.
- Added `.gitignore` (Node / Next.js / Playwright / Storybook / Turbo / Vercel / common editor folders).
- Added `.editorconfig` (2-space, UTF-8, LF, trim trailing whitespace, final newline).
- Added `docs/thinking/0.0-repo-bootstrap.md` (THINK artifact).
- Renamed `OpenProblems_MASTER_PROMPT.md` → `MASTER_PROMPT.md` to match the doc's self-references and Appendix A.

#### Unit 0.1 — Initial ADRs (0001–0005)

- Added `docs/adr/README.md` with MADR convention, numbering rule, status lifecycle, and index.
- Added ADR-0001 — Next.js 15 App Router as the application framework.
- Added ADR-0002 — Velite for the MDX content pipeline.
- Added ADR-0003 — Zod 4 as the schema source of truth.
- Added ADR-0004 — File-first storage; no database through Phase 3.
- Added ADR-0005 — Rating-action immutability.
- Added `docs/thinking/0.1-adrs.md` (THINK artifact).
- All five ADRs landed in `accepted` status following same-day human sign-off (`Date accepted: 2026-05-14`).
- Resolved `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` Q12 (package manager): **pnpm**.

#### Unit 0.2 — Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript strict scaffold

- Installed `next@15.5.18`, `react@19.2.6`, `react-dom@19.2.6`, `typescript@5.9.3`, plus matching `@types/node@22`, `@types/react@19`, `@types/react-dom@19` via pnpm 11.1.2.
- Added `package.json` with scripts `dev` / `build` / `start` / `typecheck`; `engines.node = ">=22 <24"`; `packageManager = "pnpm@11.1.2"`.
- Added `tsconfig.json` with TypeScript strict mode plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (per MASTER_PROMPT.md §14.1), `@/*` path alias, `moduleResolution: bundler`, Next.js plugin.
- Added `next.config.ts` (TS-typed); React strict mode on; Next's bundled ESLint disabled in build (Unit 0.8 owns lint); TS errors fail the build.
- Added minimal App Router stub: `app/layout.tsx` (root layout + metadata), `app/page.tsx` (RSC-only placeholder), `app/globals.css` (CSS reset + two-tone foundation, no Tailwind yet — Unit 0.3 owns that).
- Added `.nvmrc` pinning Node 22.
- Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `allowBuilds.sharp: true` (pnpm 10+ canonical project-level config; required to silence ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS and let sharp fetch its native binary for `next/image` optimization).
- Committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` for reproducibility.
- Added `docs/thinking/0.2-nextjs-scaffold.md` (THINK artifact).
- Smoke tests green: `pnpm typecheck` passes, `pnpm build` produces 4 static prerendered pages (`/`, `/_not-found`, framework routes); home page ships 123 B of route code on top of 102 kB shared framework chunks (RSC-only).
- Surfaced two new open questions: Q14 (React Compiler opt-in timing) and Q15 (Node version pin policy).

#### Unit 0.3 — Styling primitives: Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, fonts

- Installed `tailwindcss@4.3.0`, `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.3.0`, `postcss@8.5.14`. v4 is CSS-first (no `tailwind.config.ts` required); `postcss.config.mjs` wires `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- Installed shadcn/ui runtime deps directly: `clsx@2.1.1`, `tailwind-merge@3.6.0`, `class-variance-authority@0.7.1`, `lucide-react@1.14.0`. Authored `components.json` and `lib/utils.ts` (the `cn` helper) manually — `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init` is interactive and provided no flags for a clean non-interactive install at this version.
- Loaded Inter (UI), Source Serif 4 (body), and JetBrains Mono (code) via `next/font/google` as variable fonts. Each exposes a CSS variable (`--font-inter`, `--font-source-serif`, `--font-jetbrains-mono`) wired into `app/layout.tsx` and aliased to Tailwind theme tokens (`--font-sans`, `--font-serif`, `--font-mono`) in `app/globals.css`.
- `app/globals.css`: `@import "tailwindcss"` + `@theme inline` block defining color and font tokens via CSS variables; shadcn-flavored neutral palette as a Unit 0.4 placeholder (OKLCH values; will be replaced with the project's two-tone foundation and brand-accent in Unit 0.4). Added `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.
- `app/page.tsx`: end-to-end pipeline test — serif heading via `font-serif`, mono caption via `font-mono`, muted-foreground utility via shadcn token alias.
- `next/font/google` resolves font files at build time and self-hosts them — no third-party font requests at runtime.
- Smoke tests green: `pnpm typecheck` passes, `pnpm build` clean (102 kB First Load JS, unchanged from Unit 0.2 — fonts inline locally without bundle bloat).
- Surfaced Q16 (font subset — `latin` for now, `latin-ext` when content with diacritics arrives) and Q17 (shadcn base color — `neutral` placeholder).

#### Unit 0.4 — Design tokens

- Replaced Unit 0.3's shadcn-neutral placeholder palette with the project's two-tone foundation per MASTER_PROMPT §10.1: `#FAFAF7` paper-white / `#0B0D10` near-black, encoded in OKLCH for clean light↔dark interpolation. Light and dark are declared independently (not a tinted invert — §10.1's "true second design" rule).
- Brand accent landed as a **deep-cyan placeholder** (`oklch(0.55 0.12 215)` light, `oklch(0.70 0.14 215)` dark). OPEN_QUESTIONS Q5 (vermilion vs deep cyan) is unresolved; flipping to vermilion is a single-line edit on `--accent` and `--ring` in both light and dark blocks. Picked cyan as the more defensible default for §10.1's "academic-industrial" register and because cyan separates well from the warm chart hues 3 and 5.
- Added the five rating-dimension chart hues (Difficulty, Saturation, Urgency, Value, Industry Call) as `--chart-difficulty` … `--chart-industry-call`. Each is ≥ 50° hue-separated; light variants meet WCAG AA contrast against `--background`; dark variants lifted ~0.15 in lightness to preserve AA-equivalent contrast on the inverted background. Aliased into Tailwind's `bg-chart-1`…`bg-chart-5` utilities via `@theme inline`.
- Added motion tokens per §10.1 ("subtle, 150 ms ease, no bouncing"): `--ease-out`, `--ease-in-out`, `--duration-instant`/`-fast`/`-base`/`-slow` (50/100/150/250 ms). The Unit 0.3 `prefers-reduced-motion` guard remains and overrides these.
- Added a five-dimension legend on `app/page.tsx` to validate the token wiring end-to-end (rating dimensions render as `bg-chart-N` swatches with semantic labels).
- Smoke tests green: `pnpm typecheck` passes, `pnpm build` clean (still 102 kB First Load JS; tokens are pure CSS).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/0.4-design-tokens.md`. No new open questions surfaced (Q5 placeholder is documented; not a blocker).

#### Unit 0.5 — Zod schemas (lib/schemas/)

- Installed `zod@4.4.3` (ADR-0003) and `vitest@4.1.6` (the test runner subset of Unit 0.9 — Playwright, Storybook, and Lighthouse-CI still belong to 0.9).
- Authored 8 Zod schemas in `lib/schemas/`, one entity per file per §14.1 (no barrels): `taxonomy.ts` (Taxonomy + Domain + Subdomain), `benchmark.ts`, `problem.ts` (OpenProblem + ExternalLinks + Editorial + ProblemStatus), `rating-action.ts` (with the five dimensions strictly required — every action is a complete snapshot per ADR-0005), `paper.ts` (Paper + Contribution), `entry.ts` (LeaderboardEntry), `author.ts` (with ORCID regex), `institution.ts` (with ROR id regex). Shared `_primitives.ts` exposes `slug` (kebab-case `[a-z0-9-]+`) and `isoDate` (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- `TaxonomySchema` enforces per-domain subdomain uniqueness but allows cross-domain id collisions (resolves the design intent of OPEN_QUESTIONS Q11 at the schema layer; the validate-content script in Unit 0.7 will additionally verify `Problem.subdomain` exists under `Problem.domain`).
- `posed_year` and `Paper.year` use a runtime refinement against `new Date().getFullYear()` rather than a static upper bound — the "future year" check stays correct over the project lifetime.
- 41 tests across 8 files, all passing in 471 ms. Each schema has ≥ 3 tests (valid / invalid / edge) per §14.2.
- Added `vitest.config.ts` with the `@/*` alias matching `tsconfig.json`. `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:watch` scripts added.
- Smoke tests green: `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm build` clean. Schemas don't bloat the client bundle (server-only).
- Surfaced Q18 (saturation N/A encoding) for a future Phase-3 ADR.

#### Unit 0.6 — content/taxonomy.yaml

- Authored `content/taxonomy.yaml` with all 8 top-level domains and their subdomains from MASTER_PROMPT §4. Short-form lists from the master prompt (general-ml, optimization, probabilistic-methods, reinforcement-learning, theory, social-aspects) expanded to full `{ id, title }` form for consistency with the schema and editor-friendly diffs.
- Confirmed cross-domain id collisions explicitly: `robustness` under both `deep-learning` and `social-aspects`; `representation-learning` under both `deep-learning` and `general-ml`; `theory` as both a top-level domain id and a `deep-learning` subdomain id. URL strategy is domain-scoped (`/domains/[domain]/[subdomain]`), so this is by design (OPEN_QUESTIONS Q11).
- Added `lib/content/load-taxonomy.ts` — a thin async helper that reads, parses (via `yaml@2.9.0`, new devDep), and validates against `TaxonomySchema`. Used by tests in this unit; will be reused by the validate-content script (Unit 0.7) and by taxonomy-rendering routes (Unit 0.10).
- Added `lib/content/load-taxonomy.test.ts` (4 tests): file parses + validates, 8 domains in §4 order, every domain has ≥ 1 subdomain, expected cross-domain id collisions are present.
- 45 tests across 9 files now passing in 594 ms. `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build` clean.

#### Unit 0.7 — scripts/validate-content.ts

- Added `lib/content/validate.ts`: walks `content/` and validates every YAML / JSON file against the matching Zod schema from Unit 0.5. Returns a structured `{ filesChecked, errors }` result; each error carries `file`, `schema`, and a list of `{ path, message }` issues. Includes one cross-document FK check: `Problem.domain` and `Problem.subdomain` must exist in `content/taxonomy.yaml`. Other cross-FK validation (rating-action → problem, paper.contributions → benchmark, etc.) is deferred to Phase 2's separate `scripts/cross-link-audit.ts`.
- Added `scripts/validate-content.ts`: thin CLI wrapper that calls `validateContent(process.cwd()/content)`, prints results, exits 0/1. Wired as `pnpm validate-content` (uses `tsx@4.21.0`, new devDep, to run the `.ts` file directly).
- Added `test/fixtures/content-valid/` and `test/fixtures/content-invalid/` (duplicate domain id) so the validator can be Vitest-tested on happy and sad paths in addition to the real `content/`.
- `lib/content/validate.test.ts` (4 tests): valid fixture → 0 errors, invalid fixture → ≥ 1 error pointing at `Taxonomy`, real `content/` → 0 errors, tolerant of missing optional subdirs.
- 49 tests across 10 files green in 630 ms. `pnpm validate-content` on this repo reports "✓ 1 content file(s) validated against schemas."
- One Zod 4 typing wrinkle: `issue.path` is `PropertyKey[]` (includes `symbol`), not `(string|number)[]`; the `pushIssues` helper accepts the wider type and coerces with `.map(String)`.
- `esbuild` postinstall (pulled in by `tsx`) added to `pnpm-workspace.yaml#allowBuilds` (same `pnpm approve-builds --all` flow we hit for `sharp` in Unit 0.2).

#### Unit 0.8 — Lint, format, git hooks, ADR-0005 enforcement

- **ESLint 9 flat config** (`eslint.config.mjs`) with `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, and `eslint-config-prettier`. `js.configs.recommended` + `tseslint.configs.recommended` + `jsxA11y.flatConfigs.recommended` + prettier last. Per-area rule overrides: tests relax unsafe-any rules; `scripts/**` plus root `.mjs` files get Node globals via `globals.node` and allow `console`. Bumped from ESLint 10 → 9 because `eslint-plugin-import` (transitive dep of `eslint-config-next`) calls `scopeManager.addGlobals` which the 10.x scope manager dropped — surfaces as a separate question for re-enabling Next-specific rules once that lands.
- **Prettier 3** (`prettier.config.mjs`): `endOfLine: "lf"`, `printWidth: 100`, double quotes, trailing commas, `proseWrap: "preserve"`, `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` for class-order. Prettier owns formatting; ESLint owns correctness; `eslint-config-prettier` disables conflicting stylistic rules. Ran one-shot `pnpm format` to normalize the existing tree.
- **Husky 9** initialized (`prepare: husky`). `.husky/pre-commit` runs three gates in order: (1) `node scripts/check-rating-action-immutability.mjs` (ADR-0005 enforcement — refuses commits that touch existing `content/problems/*/ratings/*.yaml` via `git diff --cached --name-status` for `M`/`D`/`R`/`C`; only `A` net-new files pass); (2) `pnpm exec lint-staged`; (3) `pnpm test`. `.husky/commit-msg` runs `pnpm exec commitlint --edit "$1"`.
- **lint-staged** (config block in `package.json`): TS/JS files → `eslint --fix && prettier --write`; JSON / YAML / Markdown / CSS → `prettier --write`.
- **commitlint** (`commitlint.config.mjs`) extends `@commitlint/config-conventional`. Conventional Commits enforced locally; Unit 0.11 mirrors this in CI.
- New scripts in `package.json`: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `format:check`, `prepare`.
- All Phase 0 gates green together: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check && pnpm test && pnpm validate-content`. 49 tests across 10 files in 680 ms.
- Surfaced two open questions: Q19-style note about ESLint 10 + `eslint-config-next` regression (re-enable Next-specific rules once upstream stabilizes) and a corresponding ADR-0005 hook edge case around git rename detection (treats `R`/`C` as forbidden alongside `M`/`D`).

#### Unit 0.9 — Playwright, Storybook 10, Lighthouse CI

- Installed `@playwright/test@1.60` with `playwright.config.ts`: spec dir `e2e/`, chromium project, webServer boots `pnpm build && pnpm start` so e2e + Lighthouse share the production surface.
- `e2e/smoke.spec.ts`: home renders the project title and the five rating-dimension labels.
- Installed `@lhci/cli@0.15` with `lighthouserc.json`: desktop preset, 3 runs against `pnpm start`, assertions perf / a11y / SEO ≥ 0.95 (error), best-practices ≥ 0.95 (warn).
- Installed `storybook@10.3` + `@storybook/nextjs-vite@10.3` + `@storybook/addon-a11y` + `@storybook/addon-docs`. `.storybook/main.ts` globs stories from `components/**` and `app/**`; `.storybook/preview.ts` imports `app/globals.css` for tokens + fonts and registers `paper` / `ink` background swatches. `.storybook/Introduction.mdx` documents the stories-co-located convention.
- `vitest.config.ts` extended to a two-project config: the existing `**/*.test.ts` unit suite (49 passing) plus a Storybook stories-as-Vitest-browser-tests project via `@storybook/addon-vitest` + `@vitest/browser-playwright`. Currently no stories → no extra tests; Phase 1 components will populate it. `vitest.shims.d.ts` types `@vitest/browser-playwright`.
- New scripts: `test:e2e`, `test:e2e:install`, `lhci`, `storybook`, `build-storybook`.
- Surfaced Q23 (Vite vs Webpack — resolved in favor of Vite via `@storybook/nextjs-vite`) and Q24 (Storybook init timing — landed in Phase 0 after all).

#### Unit 0.10 — App Router stub IA for every §9 route

- Every URL from MASTER_PROMPT §9 is now a buildable Next.js App Router stub. 19 page routes + 4 API routes; the `next build` summary lists all 23 routes (10 static prerendered, 13 server-rendered on demand for dynamic / API paths). Home page route code 165 B; every other page 177 B; First Load JS = 103 kB.
- Added `components/ui/stub-page.tsx`: shared `<StubPage title description? phase?>` renderer that every page route uses. One h1 + an optional description + a "Phase N content pending" tail line.
- Added `lib/api/stub.ts`: `stubJsonResponse(endpoint)` returns HTTP 501 with `{ endpoint, status: "not-implemented", phase: 0, message }`. Every `/api/v1/*` GET handler is a one-line call to it.
- `/api/v1/rss.xml` returns a minimal valid RSS 2.0 feed with a placeholder item (W3C feed validator passes).
- `/methodology/v[N]` encoded as `app/methodology/[version]/page.tsx` (param is the literal `v1` / `v1.0` / …; alternatives documented in OPEN_QUESTIONS Q20-style note in the THINK doc).
- Home page (`app/page.tsx`) grew a "Routes" nav section linking to every top-level section, so Phase 0 reviewers (and future Playwright crawl tests) can discover the IA from `/`.
- All dynamic-segment pages use `params: Promise<{ ... }>` per the Next 15 async-params convention.
- Surfaced Q25 (API envelope shape) and Q26 (per-segment `not-found.tsx` strategy).
- Smoke gates all green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm test` (49/49), `pnpm validate-content`, `pnpm build`.

#### Unit 0.11 — GitHub Actions CI + PR template

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — fast-path CI on `pull_request` and `push` to `main`. Single `verify` job runs (in order): checkout (full history), pnpm + Node 22 setup with pnpm cache, `HUSKY=0 pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then the six gates `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm validate-content`, `pnpm build`, plus the ADR-0005 base-branch immutability check (PR events only).
- `.github/workflows/e2e-lighthouse.yml` — slow-path with two parallel jobs: Playwright e2e (caches `~/.cache/ms-playwright` keyed on the pnpm lockfile, downloads chromium with `--with-deps`, uploads the HTML report on failure) and Lighthouse CI (`pnpm build && pnpm lhci`). Both marked `continue-on-error: true` in Phase 0; Q27 covers the cutover to required at Phase 1.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` mirroring §14.4: schemas validated, ADR if architectural, CHANGELOG, tests, Lighthouse delta, OPEN_QUESTIONS updated, ADR-0005 rule for rating actions.
- `scripts/check-rating-action-immutability-ci.mjs` — Layer-3 CI variant of the local pre-commit script. Takes a base ref (e.g., `origin/main`) and compares the PR head to it via `git diff --name-status base...HEAD`, blocking any M/D/R/C against `content/problems/*/ratings/`.
- Added `docs/thinking/**` to `.prettierignore` after Prettier reinterpreted `MASTER_PROMPT.md` as italic emphasis (`_..._`) inside THINK docs and mangled it on reformat. ADRs were already excluded for the same reason.
- Surfaced Q27 (e2e + Lighthouse advisory → required at Phase 1 kickoff) and Q28 (GitHub branch-protection rules — out-of-code, set at first push to GitHub during Unit 0.12).

#### Unit 0.12 — Phase 0 acceptance gate

- Verified the local half of the §13 acceptance gate: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm test` (49/49 across 10 files), `pnpm validate-content` (1 file), `pnpm build` (23 routes — 8 static, 15 dynamic; home route code 165 B on top of 103 kB shared framework chunks).
- Two gates remain external and trigger automatically on first GitHub push: (a) Vercel preview deploy renders the stub landing; (b) Lighthouse CI runs and asserts perf / a11y / SEO ≥ 0.95 on `/`. Both are wired in `.github/workflows/e2e-lighthouse.yml` (Unit 0.11) and `lighthouserc.json` (Unit 0.9).
- README updated to reflect Phase 0 closeout and Phase 1 readiness; preserves the §13 phased rhythm and points new contributors to the same reading order.
- Phase 0 closed across 12 units / 12 commits: `0eb5b70` → `a3db1f2`. Five accepted ADRs (0001–0005). ~28 OPEN_QUESTIONS surfaced (Q1–Q9 from §17 plus Q10–Q28); Q12 and Q13 resolved.
- Handoff items (user-action): (1) push to GitHub, (2) connect Vercel, (3) configure branch protection requiring the `verify` job. None of these can be performed from the local session.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/0.12-phase-0-acceptance.md` (incl. the OPEN_QUESTIONS triage for Phase 1 blockers).

### Phase 1 — Core MVP

#### Unit 1.0 — Phase 1 prep (license, brand, accent)

- Resolved three OPEN_QUESTIONS items that Unit 0.12's triage flagged as Phase-1-blocking:
  - **Q1 — Brand name:** confirmed **LLM OpenProblems** (working title stands).
  - **Q4 — License:** **Apache-2.0** for code (explicit patent grant; defensible for a project intending a citable methodology paper) + **CC-BY-4.0** for `content/` (standard for academic-adjacent published content).
  - **Q5 — Brand accent:** **deep cyan in the "HKU green" register**, OKLCH hue 170° (between pure cyan ~195° and pure green ~145°). Replaces the Unit 0.4 placeholder at hue 215°.
- Added `LICENSE` (full Apache-2.0 text) at repo root; `content/LICENSE.md` (CC-BY-4.0 scope + canonical-text pointer + recommended citation). `package.json#license = "Apache-2.0"` (SPDX). README license section updated.
- `app/globals.css` accent values updated in light + dark blocks: `--accent`/`--ring` shifted to `oklch(0.5 0.1 170)` light / `oklch(0.7 0.13 170)` dark. `--chart-saturation` nudged from hue 160° → 140° in both blocks to preserve ≥ 30° hue separation from the new accent (otherwise chart-2 and the UI accent would be within 10° of each other).
- WCAG AA preserved: accent on background ≈ 4.7:1 light / ≈ 5.0:1 dark (≥ 4.5:1 floor); chart-2 contrast unchanged in magnitude.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.0-phase-1-prep.md`. Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` (still 103 kB First Load JS, 23 routes — no functional change, only token + license metadata).

#### Unit 1.1 — Velite content pipeline (ADR-0002)

- Installed `velite@0.3.1` as a devDep. `velite.config.ts` at repo root defines one collection — `taxonomy` (single-file YAML against `content/taxonomy.yaml`) — and produces `.velite/{index.js, index.d.ts, taxonomy.json}` on every `pnpm velite` / `pnpm build` / `pnpm dev`.
- Build chain updated: `"build": "velite && next build"` and `"dev": "velite && next dev"`. Standalone scripts: `pnpm velite`, `pnpm velite:watch`. Velite runs in 50–60 ms on the current 1-file content tree.
- `tsconfig.json` paths: added `"#site/content"` → `./.velite` and `"#site/content/*"` → `./.velite/*`. `.velite/**/*` added to `include`. Convention: routes and components import via `import { taxonomy, ... } from "#site/content"` to avoid colliding with the canonical `@/*` source namespace.
- `.gitignore`: added `.velite/`.
- Smoke proof: migrated `app/domains/page.tsx` from a Phase 0 `<StubPage>` to a real list rendered from `#site/content` — 8 domains, each linking to `/domains/[id]` and showing subdomain count. Route stays statically prerendered (no client JS for the taxonomy data); First Load JS for `/domains` is 106 kB (+3 kB over the stub, from the inlined taxonomy.json embed and `next/link`). All other routes unchanged at 103 kB.
- **Velite + Zod 4 wrinkle.** Velite 0.3.x bundles Zod 3 internally and its runtime calls `schema._parse(...)`, which Zod 4 renamed. Passing the canonical schemas in `lib/schemas/*` directly to `defineCollection({ schema })` throws. Interim workaround: the taxonomy schema is duplicated in `velite.config.ts` using Velite's bundled `s` factory. Single-file duplication; cross-validated against the canonical Zod-4 schema by `scripts/validate-content.ts` (Unit 0.7), so drift surfaces in CI. Tracked as OPEN_QUESTIONS Q31 with the upstream-monitoring action item. Later content units (1.3 methodology, 1.4 first problem) extend `velite.config.ts` with their collections; the duplication remains contained until Velite ships Zod-4 support.
- New OPEN_QUESTIONS: Q29 (Velite MDX plugins — KaTeX + Shiki land in Unit 1.3, Mermaid deferred), Q30 (publishing the snapshot via `/api/v1/snapshot.json` — defer to Unit 1.10+), Q31 (Velite + Zod 4 — see above).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.1-velite-pipeline.md`. Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (49/49), `pnpm validate-content` (1 file), `pnpm build` (23 routes).

#### Unit 1.2 — Dark-mode toggle (persisted)

- Installed `next-themes@0.4.6`. `<ThemeProvider>` (`components/theme-provider/`) wraps the root with `attribute="class"`, `defaultTheme="system"`, `enableSystem`, `disableTransitionOnChange`. `<html>` gets `suppressHydrationWarning` and the className list now flows through `cn(...)` again.
- `app/globals.css` activation swapped from `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) :root { ... }` to `.dark { ... }`. Same OKLCH values, same variable names — only the selector that activates them changed.
- Added `<ThemeToggle>` (`components/theme-toggle/`): three-state cycle button (`light → dark → system → light`) with lucide icons (`Sun`, `Moon`, `Monitor`). aria-label and tooltip reflect the *next* state. Renders a transparent placeholder of equal footprint before hydration so layout doesn't shift.
- Smoke proof: home page (`/`) gets `<ThemeToggle>` in the top-right of `<main>`. Will move to a global header in Unit 1.10.
- Bundle: `/` route went from 165 B → 11.7 kB (First Load JS 103 kB → 118 kB) because the toggle pulls in next-themes + tree-shaken lucide icons. Under the 180 kB Problem-detail budget; same bump amortises across every page once the toggle moves into the shared header.
- Closes OPEN_QUESTIONS Q18 (dark-mode activation mechanism — proposed in the Unit 0.4 THINK doc; never landed in OPEN_QUESTIONS.md). The decision: `next-themes` + `.dark` class, system-default with localStorage persistence.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.2-dark-mode-toggle.md`. Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` clean, `pnpm build` clean (23 routes, /  bundle 118 kB).

#### Unit 1.3 — Methodology page (MDX + KaTeX + Shiki)

- Authored `content/methodology/v1.mdx` (~180 lines): the v1.0.0 rating methodology covering §8.1–§8.6 — first principles, the five dimensions (with the Difficulty grade table), the saturation formula in KaTeX, the composite formula and default weights, confidence + WATCH treatment, the rating-actions log, the COI policy, and the methodology-versioning SemVer rules.
- Wired the Velite MDX pipeline. New deps: `remark-math@6`, `rehype-katex@7`, `rehype-pretty-code@0.14`, `shiki@4`, `katex@0.16`. `velite.config.ts` gains the `methodology` collection with `s.mdx({ ... })` and `mdx.{remarkPlugins, rehypePlugins}` configured for math + code highlight. Default Shiki theme: `github-light` / `github-dark` (next-themes drives the class switch).
- `lib/mdx/mdx-content.tsx` — server component that takes a Velite-compiled MDX `code` string and renders it via `new Function(code)({ ...jsxRuntime })`. Reusable by Unit 1.4 problem MDX.
- `app/methodology/page.tsx` — sorts the collection by SemVer-aware comparator and renders the highest version. Header shows version, date, and links to every other version snapshot.
- `app/methodology/[version]/page.tsx` — `generateStaticParams` from the collection so every `v<X.Y.Z>` URL is statically built. `notFound()` on unknown versions.
- `app/layout.tsx` imports `katex/dist/katex.min.css` once so any MDX page rendering math gets correct typography.
- Closes Q29 (Velite MDX plugin set — KaTeX + Shiki in, Mermaid deferred until first content author asks). Opens Q32 (Shiki single vs dual theme — landed dual; revisit if it bites perf).
- Smoke gates green: Velite builds in ~840 ms (vs ~60 ms before MDX); `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm validate-content` / `pnpm test` (49/49) / `pnpm build` all clean. `/methodology` is statically prerendered (106 kB First Load JS); `/methodology/v1.0.0` is SSG-prerendered (103 kB).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.3-methodology-page.md`.

#### Unit 1.4 — First seed problem: `hallucination-reduction`

- Authored the first end-to-end §16 seed:
  - `content/problems/hallucination-reduction/problem.yaml` — `OpenProblem` for "Faithful & Calibrated Hallucination Reduction in LLMs"; `deep-learning / large-language-models`; status `open`; posed-year 2022; 4 benchmarks (HaluEval, TruthfulQA-2026, SimpleQA, FACTS Grounding) with `metric_direction` only — no scores yet (§15.6: don't invent numbers).
  - `background.mdx` / `definition.mdx` / `history.mdx` — three MDX prose files framing (a) the faithfulness / factuality / calibration distinction; (b) a working formal definition with KaTeX notation; (c) the 2020–2026 chronology, ending on the Yang et al. NeurIPS 2025 inverse-scaling finding.
  - `ratings/2026-05-14-initial.yaml` — editorial baseline rating action: **Difficulty A · Saturation 35 (`TODO(curate)` actual SOTA) · Urgency 5 · Value 5 · Industry Call 5**; confidence 0.55–0.80 per dimension; one-paragraph rationale per dimension. Lists the five signals weighed (Yang et al. 2025 inverse-scaling, HaluEval, TruthfulQA-2026, SimpleQA, FACTS Grounding, 2026 safety reports).
- Extended `velite.config.ts` with three new collections: `problems` (per-dir `problem.yaml`), `ratings` (per-dir `ratings/*.yaml`), `problemPages` (the three MDX files; transformed to `{ problem_slug, kind: "background"|"definition"|"history", body, title, summary }`). Same `s`-based duplication pattern as Unit 1.1 (Q31).
- Velite now emits `problems.json`, `ratings.json`, `problemPages.json` in `.velite/`. Build takes ~860 ms (≈unchanged from Unit 1.3 — MDX compilation dominates).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm velite` clean; `pnpm validate-content` reports **3 content files** validated (was 1 — taxonomy + problem.yaml + rating); `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (49/49), `pnpm build` (23 routes) all clean.
- Opens Q33 (`<Cite paper="…">` component shape, deferred to Phase 2's citation system) and Q34 (`entries.json` for this seed, deferred to Phase 2 with first verified entries).
- The first rating-action file lands as net-new under `content/problems/*/ratings/` — the Unit 0.8 ADR-0005 pre-commit hook allows `A` (new) status; only `M`/`D`/`R` are blocked. Verifies the immutability-by-construction flow end-to-end.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.4-first-seed-problem.md`.

#### Unit 1.5 — RatingRadar v1

- `components/viz/RatingRadar/` ships viz catalog entry #1 from §11: 5-axis SVG radar, animated entry (250 ms ease-out, scale 0.5→1), confidence-shaded fill (mean dimension confidence mapped to `[0.15, 0.55]` opacity), per-axis chart-hue dots with native `<title>` tooltips, and `<desc>` describing every dimension for screen readers. Pure RSC — no `"use client"`, no client JS.
- Shape: viewBox 0 0 200 200, max radius 80, five axes at -90° / -18° / 54° / 126° / 198° (first axis points up = Difficulty), dimension order Difficulty · Saturation · Urgency · Value · Industry Call (matches `--color-chart-1..5` per §3.1).
- `lib/ratings/normalize.ts` centralises the `[0, 5]` projection used by both the radar and §8.3's composite formula: Difficulty grade → 5..0, Saturation → (100 − value) / 20, stars → identity. Also exports `meanConfidence(points)` and a Phase-0 `composite(points)` using §8.3 default weights (0.25 / 0.25 / 0.20 / 0.15 / 0.15).
- `lib/ratings/normalize.test.ts` — 13 tests across `dimensionsToRadar`, `meanConfidence`, `composite`. `components/viz/RatingRadar/index.test.tsx` — 6 tests (renders SVG with role/aria-label, five axis lines + five value dots, exactly one polygon, `<desc>` summarises every dimension, all five chart-hue references emitted, no entry animation in `staticRender` mode). Total **68 tests across 13 files** (was 49 across 10).
- Storybook stories: high-confidence, low-confidence WATCH, all-zeros (solved), and a small `size: 120` variant — the four states future visual-regression baselines will lock down at Unit 1.12.
- Vitest default project gained `@vitejs/plugin-react@6` for JSX in `.test.tsx` files (the Storybook-vitest project already had Vite + React via `@storybook/addon-vitest`).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.5-rating-radar.md`. Surfaced Q35 (companion table-fallback toggle lives on the problem-detail page, Unit 1.6 — §10.2 "every chart is also a table" is satisfied at the consumer, not in the viz primitive).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (68/68), `pnpm build` (23 routes, all unchanged).

#### Unit 1.6 — Problem detail page `/problems/[slug]`

- Implements the §9 ten-block layout in order: (1) breadcrumb + title + status pill + last-curated date, (2) `RatingRadar` (latest action) + "View as table" disclosure that satisfies §10.2 / Q35, (3) TL;DR from `problem.subtitle`, (4) Background MDX, (5) Formal definition MDX (with KaTeX), (6) Benchmarks table — name / dataset / metric+direction / ceiling / protocol link — plus "View full leaderboard →", (7) History MDX, (8) Recent rating actions (top 3, descending by date) + "View full history →", (9) Related problems as pill links (cross-FK audit deferred to Phase 2), (10) Citation block with a BibTeX `<pre>`.
- `lib/content/load-problem.ts` consolidates Velite consumption: `loadProblem(slug)` returns `{ problem, pages: { background?, definition?, history? }, ratings, latestRating, taxonomy: { domain, subdomain } }` with taxonomy-FK resolution at request time. `allProblemSlugs()` powers `generateStaticParams`. Unknown slug → `notFound()`.
- `components/ui/status-pill/` — RSC pill mapping each of the 5 statuses to a chart-hue ring; open is foreground/40.
- Bundle: `/problems/[slug]` SSG-prerendered (`/problems/hallucination-reduction` so far), 170 B route code + 106 kB First Load JS (small uptick from the inlined Velite data). Pure RSC; the only "interactivity" is native `<details>` for the table-fallback. Stays well under §10.4's 180 kB problem-detail JS budget.
- KaTeX renders inline + display math in the definition MDX; Shiki dual-theme code blocks (already wired in Unit 1.3) handle any future code in the prose. The `prose` Tailwind plugin is NOT in use yet — Unit 1.3's `prose-neutral dark:prose-invert` classes are inert pending Phase 1.10's typography pass.
- Opens Q36 (citation URL canonicalisation — placeholder `https://llm-openproblems.org`; reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` when set).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.6-problem-detail-page.md`. Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (68/68), `pnpm validate-content` (3 files), `pnpm build` (23 routes).

#### Unit 1.7 — Domain & subdomain hub pages (3 routes)

- `/domains` upgraded from the Unit 1.1 smoke-proof list to a responsive tile grid (1/2/3 columns) showing every top-level domain with subdomain count + curated-problem count per domain.
- `/domains/[domain]` SSG-prerenders each of the 8 domains: breadcrumb, title, subdomain list (2-column grid with per-subdomain problem counts), and a "Featured problems" section (top 3 by `editorial.last_curated` desc, with `StatusPill`). Unknown domain id → `notFound()`.
- `/domains/[domain]/[subdomain]` SSG-prerenders all ~80 (domain, subdomain) pairs. Renders a simple problem list with title link, last-curated date, and status pill; empty-state copy points contributors to `/contributing`. `notFound()` on either segment.
- `lib/content/load-domain.ts` centralises Velite taxonomy + problem joins: `loadDomain`, `loadSubdomain`, `problemsInDomain`, `problemsInSubdomain`, `allDomainIds`, `allDomainSubdomainPairs`.
- Q11 end-to-end verification: `representation-learning` resolves to distinct pages at `/domains/deep-learning/representation-learning` and `/domains/general-ml/representation-learning`. The URL space is domain-scoped; no flat `/subdomains/[id]` route exists.
- All three routes are RSC + SSG, zero client JS. THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.7-domain-hub-pages.md`.

#### Unit 1.8 — Problems index `/problems` with client-side filter + sort

- `app/problems/page.tsx` flips from Phase 0 `<StubPage>` to a real index. Server entry pre-computes the `IndexedProblem[]` (slug, title, status, domain/subdomain titles, tags, last-curated, normalized `points[]`, mean confidence, `composite`) at build time; client island `components/problems-index/` owns filter + sort UI.
- Filters: domain (8 options), status (5 enums), tag (auto-discovered from content). Sort: title / last-curated / composite, with ↑↓ direction toggle on the active sort. "Clear" button resets all filters. Tag chips on each row are clickable — toggles the tag filter to that tag (or off if already active).
- Each row shows the §8.3 composite numerically plus a five-segment dimension breakdown bar (chart-1..5, widths proportional to the normalized 0–5 value). §8.3's "composite never shown alone" rule satisfied by always rendering the dimension chips alongside.
- Bundle: `/problems` static-prerendered, 2.2 kB route code + 117 kB First Load JS (≈14 kB for the filter UI on top of the shared baseline). Acceptable.
- `lib/content/load-problems-index.ts` exposes `getIndexedProblems()` reusable by the landing page (Unit 1.10) and Phase 2's MoversBoard.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.8-problems-index.md`. Smoke: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` (23 routes — /problems and /problems/[slug] both static; no regression on other routes).

#### Unit 1.9 — Search palette (Fuse.js + Cmd/Ctrl-K)

- `fuse.js@7.3.0` installed; `lib/search/build-index.ts` exports `getSearchIndex()` that joins `problems` + `taxonomy` into a flat `SearchRecord[]` shape (`id`, `kind`, `title`, `subtitle?`, `tags`, `domainTitle?`, `subdomainTitle?`, `href`). `kind: "problem"` is the only kind in Phase 1; paper / author / institution kinds extend the schema later without breaking the renderer.
- `components/search-palette/` — client dialog. Fuse over 5 weighted keys (title × 3, subtitle × 2, tags × 1.5, domain / subdomain × 1; threshold 0.4, ignoreLocation, minMatchCharLength 1). ↑↓ navigates, Enter opens, Esc closes; backdrop click closes. Locks body scroll while open. `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal` + auto-focused input. Footer keyboard-hint strip.
- `components/search-trigger/` — visible button with `⌘K` kbd hint; mounts the palette only after hydration via `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })`. Cmd+K / Ctrl+K toggles the palette globally.
- `components/site-header/` — sticky top-of-page header that mounts in `app/layout.tsx`. Provides primary nav (Domains / Problems / Methodology / Trending), the site title link, plus the `SearchTrigger` and `ThemeToggle` in the right rail. Backdrop-blur on scroll.
- Bundle: home `/` is now 12.0 kB (up from 11.7 kB after the Unit 1.2 toggle landed; the +0.3 kB is the SearchTrigger placeholder + kbd shortcut hook). The palette itself is lazy-loaded — its Fuse + JSX cost is only paid the first time Cmd+K fires.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.9-search-palette.md`. Smoke: `pnpm build` green; tests untouched (68/68 still).

#### Unit 1.10 — Landing page v1

- `app/page.tsx` flips from the Phase 0 dimension-legend + stub-routes scaffold to the §13 Phase 1 landing: hero (h1 + tagline + two CTAs to `/problems` and `/methodology`), "Recently rated" section, "By domain" tile grid, and a methodology blurb. Pure RSC — every section above the SiteHeader's client islands is server-rendered HTML so the LCP candidate (the hero `<h1>`) hits the wire as static markup (§10.4 budget: LCP < 1.8 s on slow 4G).
- `components/domain-tile-grid/` — extracted the Unit 1.7 `/domains` grid into a shared RSC. `app/domains/page.tsx` now imports it; the landing page reuses the same component so the two surfaces stay visually identical and one fix updates both. Link styling, problem/subdomain counts, and hover transitions preserved verbatim.
- `components/recently-rated/` — RSC that calls `getIndexedProblems()`, filters to rows with a `latestRatingDate`, sorts by date desc (title asc as the deterministic tie-breaker), and renders the top N (default 5) as cards with title, `<StatusPill>`, domain · subdomain breadcrumb, the `latestRatingDate`, the §8.3 advisory composite, and a tag chip row (capped at 4 tags). Empty-state copy points at `/contributing`.
- `lib/content/load-problems-index.ts` extended: `IndexedProblem.latestRatingDate?: string` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, set only when the problem has a rating). Existing callers (problems index, future MoversBoard) unaffected; `RecentlyRated` reads it; the §13 deliverable specifies "rating-action date desc" rather than `editorial.last_curated`.
- Bundle: `/` route went from 12.0 kB / 118 kB First Load JS (where it sat after Unit 1.2 added the inline `ThemeToggle` to the home page) down to **162 B / 106 kB**. The toggle and `SearchTrigger` moved into the shared `<SiteHeader>` (Unit 1.9), so they no longer count toward the home-page route chunk — they're amortized across every page via the shared layout chunks. Net win for landing-page LCP.
- Tradeoff flagged: §13 reads "Recently rated **carousel**". With ≤ 5 rated problems in Phase 1, a real carousel widget (e.g. embla-carousel, ~9 kB gz) is not justified — the section is a static responsive grid. Marked in the THINK doc as a Phase-2 revisit once rating-action volume warrants horizontal scroll / arrows.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.10-landing-page-v1.md`. Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (68/68 across 13 files), `pnpm validate-content` (3 files), `pnpm build` (23 routes — only `/` and `/domains` touched).

#### Unit 1.11 — Seed problems 2–10 (full §16 ten-problem set)

- Authored the 9 remaining seeds from MASTER_PROMPT §16, bringing `content/problems/` to the 10-problem target named in the §13 Phase 1 acceptance gate (above the §13 minimum of 6). Each follows the Unit 1.4 folder shape: `problem.yaml` + `background.mdx` + `definition.mdx` + `history.mdx` + `ratings/2026-05-14-initial.yaml`. Per §15.6, benchmark scores carry `metric_direction` only — no fabricated numbers; each rating action documents `signals_considered`. Confidence ranges 0.5–0.7 (lower than seed #1's 0.55–0.80, reflecting first-pass authoring).
- Slugs and taxonomy assignments: `long-horizon-agent-reliability` (DL/LLMs) · `scalable-oversight` (Social/Alignment) · `mechanistic-interpretability` (Social/Accountability-Interpretability) · `compute-optimal-test-time-reasoning` (DL/Algorithms) · `multi-agent-llm-coordination` (RL/Multi-agent) · `genome-foundation-models` (Apps/Health) · `operator-learning-foundation-models` (Apps/Chem-Phys-Earth) · `benchmark-integrity` (General-ML/Evaluation) · `long-context-rag` (DL/LLMs).
- Build surface jumped from 103 → 112 statically prerendered routes (+9, one per new seed via `generateStaticParams` on `/problems/[slug]`). `pnpm validate-content` now reports 21 content files (1 taxonomy + 10 problem.yaml + 10 rating actions). All other routes unchanged; no client-JS impact (pure content addition).
- Two seeds (`benchmark-integrity`, `long-context-rag`) co-authored via the parallel-curator workflow (`021bf7e`'s curator-prompt scaffolding); slug + cross-link review reconciled before commit. `multi-agent-llm-coordination` and `operator-learning-foundation-models` rating files received quoting fixes from the linter on `[[wikilink]]`-bearing list items (YAML flow-array ambiguity).
- Build-fix: `long-context-rag/definition.mdx` MDX frontmatter wrapped its math-bearing `summary:` in double quotes. The unquoted form contained `$\text{RAG}_M : (x, C) \mapsto y$` whose `:` was parsed as a YAML mapping separator. Wrapping in `"..."` and escaping `\\` for the YAML escape layer keeps the KaTeX intact.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.11-seed-problems.md`. Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (68/68), `pnpm validate-content` (21 files), `pnpm build` (32 routes total: 26 static / 5 dynamic / 1 SSG-with-multiple-paths surface; First Load JS unchanged).

#### Unit 1.12 — Phase 1 acceptance gate

- Rewrote [e2e/smoke.spec.ts](../../e2e/smoke.spec.ts) for the §13 Phase 1 surface (the Phase 0 home-page-h1 + dimension-legend spec was broken after Unit 1.10's landing redesign). Three describe blocks: (1) landing renders the hero h1 + four header-nav links + two CTAs; (2) §13 nav path traverses `/` → `/domains` → `/domains/deep-learning` → `/domains/deep-learning/large-language-models` → `/problems/hallucination-reduction` → `/problems/hallucination-reduction/leaderboard` with one click per step and asserts the RatingRadar is visible; (3) visual-regression baseline on the RatingRadar via `toHaveScreenshot("rating-radar-hallucination-reduction.png", { animations: "disabled", maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.005 })`.
- Captured the chromium/win32 RatingRadar baseline at [e2e/smoke.spec.ts-snapshots/](../../e2e/smoke.spec.ts-snapshots/) (16 kB PNG). All 3 Playwright tests pass locally in ~41 s end-to-end (production build + 3 chromium workers). The Linux/CI baseline must be captured on first CI run (Playwright snapshots are platform-suffixed); plan is one follow-on commit from the artifact upload — documented in the THINK doc as tradeoff #2.
- Extended [lighthouserc.json](../../lighthouserc.json) to assert perf / a11y / SEO ≥ 0.95 (best-practices ≥ 0.95 warn) on the three §13 acceptance URLs: `/`, `/problems/hallucination-reduction`, `/domains/deep-learning`. 3 runs × 3 URLs × desktop preset. Local lhci skipped (Lighthouse results on Windows are not authoritative; CI Ubuntu is the gate, and bundles haven't grown since Unit 1.10's measurement showed home at 162 B / 106 kB First Load JS).
- Promoted both jobs in [.github/workflows/e2e-lighthouse.yml](../../.github/workflows/e2e-lighthouse.yml) from advisory (`continue-on-error: true`) to required (the flag removed). Closes OPEN_QUESTIONS Q27 — from Phase 1 onward, e2e + Lighthouse failures block PRs alongside the existing fast-path verify job.
- Tradeoffs flagged in the THINK doc: (a) visual-regression scope is the live radar inside `/problems/[slug]` rather than per-story Storybook snapshots — clean Phase-2 follow-on once Storybook static artifacts are part of CI; (b) per-platform baseline reconciliation as noted above; (c) no `generateMetadata` speculatively added — root-layout `metadata` propagates title + description to all pages, sufficient for the SEO floor (measure first, only add per-route metadata if Lighthouse docks).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/1.12-acceptance-gate.md`. Local gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (68/68 across 13 files), `pnpm validate-content` (21 files), `pnpm build` (32 routes; all bundle sizes unchanged from Unit 1.11), `pnpm exec playwright test` (3 passed in 41.4 s). Phase 1 closes pending the CI Ubuntu pass on the §13 Lighthouse + visual-regression gate.

### Phase 2 — Papers, Authors, Institutions, Leaderboards

#### Unit 2.0 — Phase 2 prep (THINK doc + unit breakdown + OPEN_QUESTIONS surface)

- Docs-only prep unit (commit `4b61cba`). Inventories what's already in place from Phase 0–1 (canonical Zod-4 schemas in `lib/schemas/{paper,author,institution,entry,benchmark}.ts` since Unit 0.5; `lib/content/validate.ts` already glob-walks the empty `content/{papers,authors,institutions}/` dirs; route stubs from Unit 0.10 await replacement; the `signals_considered:` lists across the 10 Phase-1 seed problems are the seed-paper inventory).
- Proposes a 13-unit Phase 2 breakdown: 2.1 authors+institutions content · 2.2 Velite collections + load helpers · 2.3 author/institution detail pages · 2.4–2.6 seed papers in three batches (target 30–40 papers) · 2.7 paper detail page · 2.8 papers index · 2.9 per-problem leaderboard route · 2.10 entries.json per problem · 2.11 cross-link audit script (the §13 acceptance-gate deliverable) · 2.12 aggregate rollups · 2.13 Phase 2 acceptance gate.
- Surfaces Q32 (cross-link audit strictness on asymmetric `related_problems` — lean: warn, not block, to keep the parallel-curator workflow viable), Q33 (default leaderboard sort — lean: score direction-aware then date desc), Q34 (author cumulative-impact-score function — Phase 2 picks a simple default; Phase 3's recompose UI may obsolete the choice), Q35 (verified-flag provenance — Phase 2 default: only the primary curator at author time).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.0-phase-2-prep.md`. No code changes.

#### Unit 2.1 — Authors + institutions content; font subset latin-ext (Q16 close)

- Lands the first Phase-2 content (commit `a2a2c67`):
  - `content/institutions/` (8): `openai`, `anthropic`, `google-deepmind`, `meta-fair`, `microsoft-research`, `stanford-university`, `mit`, `uc-berkeley`. Each `{ slug, display_name, country, type, homepage }`; `ror_id` deferred to a verified-lookup pass per §15.6 (the schema makes it optional).
  - `content/authors/` (5): `yejin-choi`, `percy-liang`, `owain-evans`, `jacob-steinhardt`, `dario-amodei`. Each `{ slug, display_name, affiliations: [] }`. Affiliations are intentionally empty in this batch — `AffiliationSchema` requires a `from` ISO date and authoring those without a verified public-record date would violate §15.6. Affiliations land alongside the seed-paper batches (Units 2.4–2.6) where each paper's publication date pins a verifiable lower bound.
- `app/layout.tsx` font subset expanded to `["latin", "latin-ext"]` across all three Inter / Source Serif 4 / JetBrains Mono families. Closes OPEN_QUESTIONS Q16 — author display names with diacritics (`Łukasz`, `Müller`, `François`) now render in the project font instead of falling back to the system font. Cost: ~+60 KB across the three families; absorbed into the existing `next/font/google` self-hosting pipeline (no third-party fetch at runtime).
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` jumps from 21 to 34 files (+13 = +5 authors + 8 institutions); typecheck / build clean.

#### Unit 2.2 — Velite collections + load helpers for papers / authors / institutions

- Wires the three Phase-2 entity collections into the Velite pipeline (commit `d5189ea`). `velite.config.ts` adds `Paper`, `Author`, `Institution` collections plus inline Zod-3 sub-schemas (`PaperS`, `AuthorS`, `InstitutionS`, `ContributionS`, `AffiliationS`) duplicated from the canonical Zod-4 source per OPEN_QUESTIONS Q31 — `scripts/validate-content.ts` cross-checks the canonical schemas to surface any drift in CI.
- Three load-helpers in `lib/content/`, each with cross-collection joins the Phase-2 detail pages will consume:
  - [load-paper.ts](../../lib/content/load-paper.ts) — `loadPaper(id)` + `allPaperIds()`. Resolves `paper.authors[]` and `paper.institutions[]` slug arrays against the matching collections, tracks `unresolvedAuthorSlugs` / `unresolvedInstitutionSlugs` for the cross-link audit (Unit 2.11), enriches `contributions[]` with the parent `Problem` from the `problems` collection.
  - [load-author.ts](../../lib/content/load-author.ts) — `loadAuthor(slug)` + `allAuthorSlugs()`. Joins `affiliations[].institution` to the institutions collection, finds every paper where the slug appears in `paper.authors[]`, derives the deduped `problemsTouched` set from the union of those papers' `contributions[].problem_slug`.
  - [load-institution.ts](../../lib/content/load-institution.ts) — `loadInstitution(slug)` + `allInstitutionSlugs()`. Resolves authors via `affiliations[].institution`, papers via `paper.institutions[]`, and computes ranked `subdomainCoverage` (one entry per `(domain_id, subdomain_id)` weighted by paper count, sorted by paperCount desc with title tiebreak).
- `vitest.config.ts` adds the `#site/content` resolve alias so the loader tests can import the Velite outputs at runtime.
- New test file [lib/content/load-entities.test.ts](../../lib/content/load-entities.test.ts) — 8 tests across the three loaders covering null returns on unknown slugs, the seed-set resolves, and that joins are empty until papers land in Units 2.4–2.6. Total **76 tests across 14 files** (was 68/13).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (76/76), `pnpm validate-content` (34 files), `pnpm build` (117 routes; bundles unchanged on existing surfaces; `/papers`, `/papers/[id]`, `/authors/[slug]`, `/institutions/[slug]` route bundles still at the Unit 0.10 stub baseline since the page replacements are Unit 2.3).

#### Unit 2.3 — Author + institution detail pages (replaces Unit 0.10 stubs)

- Replaces the Unit 0.10 `StubPage` placeholders at `/authors/[slug]` and `/institutions/[slug]` with real detail pages backed by the Unit 2.2 load-helpers (commit `c1cf7ae`). Both routes are now SSG via `generateStaticParams` over `allAuthorSlugs()` / `allInstitutionSlugs()` — **5 author paths + 8 institution paths prerendered** (the 5+8 from Unit 2.1).
- `/authors/[slug]` sections (RSC, no client JS): header (display_name + `@slug` + external links to homepage / ORCID / Google Scholar when present); Affiliations (each `affiliations[].institution` slug resolves to a `/institutions/[slug]` link, with `from … → present|to` date range); Papers (every paper this author appears on; empty placeholder until Units 2.4–2.6); Problems touched (deduped via `union(papers[].contributions[].problem_slug)`). The cumulative-impact score deferred to Unit 2.12.
- `/institutions/[slug]` sections (RSC): header (display_name + type + country + homepage); Affiliated authors (every author whose `affiliations[].institution` matches this slug); Papers (every paper with this slug in `paper.institutions[]`); ranked Subdomain coverage (one entry per `(domain, subdomain)` weighted by paper count, deduped per paper, sorted by paperCount desc with subdomain-title alphabetical tiebreak).
- Empty-state copy on each section names which Phase 2 unit fills it in, so the page reads coherently before the seed-paper content batches commit.
- Bundle: build surface goes from 117 → **125 routes** — `/authors/[slug]` (5 paths, 181 B / 106 kB First Load JS) and `/institutions/[slug]` (8 paths, 181 B / 106 kB) both `●` SSG; the +8 over Unit 2.2 is the 8 institution paths newly prerendered (the 5 author paths were already on the surface from Unit 2.2's loaders). Other route bundles unchanged.

#### Unit 2.5 — Seed papers batch 2 (10 papers across 4 problems)

- Second Phase-2 paper-content batch. Lands 10 paper YAMLs covering `mechanistic-interpretability` (3), `scalable-oversight` (3), `multi-agent-llm-coordination` (2), and `long-context-rag` (2). Brings `content/papers/` to **20 of the 30–50 §13 target**; Unit 2.6 closes the floor.
- Papers (`id == arxiv_id`):
  - **mechanistic-interpretability** — `2211.00593` (IOI circuit, Wang et al. NeurIPS 2022; backs the `ioi-family` benchmark) · `2309.08600` (Sparse Autoencoders Find Highly Interpretable Features, Cunningham et al. arXiv 2023; backs `saebench`) · `2304.14997` (Towards Automated Circuit Discovery / ACDC, Conmy et al. NeurIPS 2023; backs `circuit-recovery`).
  - **scalable-oversight** — `1805.00899` (AI Safety via Debate, Irving/Christiano/Amodei 2018; backs `debate-arena`) · `2211.03540` (Measuring Progress on Scalable Oversight, Anthropic 2022; sandwich-experiment foundational) · `2311.12022` (GPQA, Rein et al. COLM 2024; backs `gpqa-diamond`).
  - **multi-agent-llm-coordination** — `2308.00352` (MetaGPT, Hong et al. ICLR 2024) · `2308.11432` (A Survey on LLM-based Autonomous Agents, Wang et al. 2023).
  - **long-context-rag** — `2005.11401` (RAG, Lewis et al. NeurIPS 2020; foundational) · `2404.06654` (RULER, Hsieh et al. COLM 2024; backs `ruler`).
- Conventions inherited from Unit 2.4: `authors[]` left empty (the 12 seed-author YAMLs on disk don't cover any of these 10 papers — Phase-2 cross-link audit / Unit 2.11 will surface for backfill); `institutions[]` only populated where the lead lab matches an existing seed slug (`uc-berkeley`, `openai`, `anthropic` ×2, `meta-fair` here — 5 of 10); every `evidence:` is an `https://arxiv.org/abs/<id>` URL; no `score:` fields per §15.6.
- HF MCP `paper_search` was unavailable while this unit ran (`Server not found`); proceeded under the CURATION contract's "MCP unavailable — passive review only" rule using only the anchor signals already named in the four problem.yamls.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` reports **62 content files** (was 52 after Unit 2.4: +10 paper YAMLs); `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm build` 133 routes (no new SSG paths — `/papers/[id]` stays `ƒ` dynamic until Unit 2.7 lands the paper detail page).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.5-seed-papers-batch-2.md`.

#### Unit 2.6 — Seed papers batch 3 (closes the §13 30-paper floor)

- Third and final §13-floor paper-content batch. Lands 10 paper YAMLs covering `operator-learning-foundation-models` (5), `genome-foundation-models` (2), and `benchmark-integrity` (3). Brings `content/papers/` to **30 of the 30–50 §13 target** — floor cleared.
- Papers (`id == arxiv_id`):
  - **operator-learning-foundation-models** — `1910.03193` (DeepONet, Lu/Jin/Karniadakis 2019) · `2010.08895` (Fourier Neural Operator, Li et al. ICLR 2021) · `2202.11214` (FourCastNet, Pathak et al. arXiv 2022) · `2211.02556` (Pangu-Weather, Bi et al. *Nature* 2023) · `2212.12794` (GraphCast, Lam et al. *Science* 2023; only paper in this batch with a seed-institution match — `google-deepmind`).
  - **genome-foundation-models** — `2306.15794` (Nucleotide Transformer, Dalla-Torre et al. 2023; backs `rare-variant-zero-shot`) · `2306.15006` (DNABERT-2, Zhou et al. 2023; *medium-confidence* on the exact arXiv ID, flagged in the THINK doc for Unit 2.11 audit).
  - **benchmark-integrity** — `1909.03004` (Show Your Work, Dodge et al. EMNLP 2019; reporting-hygiene foundation) · `2203.08242` (Data Contamination: From Memorization to Exploitation, Magar & Schwartz ACL 2022; backs `contamination-detection`) · `2305.10160` (Stop Uploading Test Data, Jacovi et al. EMNLP 2023; backs `held-out-replication`).
- Conventions inherited from Units 2.4 / 2.5: `authors[]` uniformly empty (slug minting deferred); `institutions[]` only populated where the lead lab matches an existing seed slug (1 of 10 in this batch — `google-deepmind` on GraphCast; vs. 5 of 10 in Unit 2.5; the other lead institutions here — Brown, Caltech, NVIDIA, Huawei, InstaDeep — aren't in the seed set and would need their own YAMLs); every `evidence:` is an `https://arxiv.org/abs/<id>` URL; no `score:` fields per §15.6.
- HF MCP `paper_search` remains unavailable; proceeded under the same "MCP unavailable — passive review only" rule as Unit 2.5 using the anchor signals named in the three problem.yamls.
- §13 stretch target (40 papers, +10 over the floor) is best executed via PAPER-INGEST runs once Unit 2.7 (paper detail page) lands — see [docs/PAPER_INGEST_RUNBOOK.md](../../docs/PAPER_INGEST_RUNBOOK.md). The trunk units (2.7 paper detail + 2.8 papers index + 2.9 per-problem leaderboard + 2.10 entries.json + 2.11 cross-link audit + 2.12 aggregate rollups + 2.13 acceptance gate) own the rest of Phase 2.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` reports **72 content files** (was 62 after Unit 2.5: +10 papers); `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm build` 133 routes (no new SSG paths — `/papers/[id]` still `ƒ` dynamic until Unit 2.7).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6-seed-papers-batch-3.md`.

#### Unit 2.7 — Paper detail page `/papers/[id]` (replaces Unit 0.10 stub)

- Replaces the Unit 0.10 `StubPage` at `/papers/[id]` with a real four-block RSC detail page backed by [`loadPaper`](../../lib/content/load-paper.ts). `generateStaticParams` over `allPaperIds()` prerenders all 30 paper paths as SSG.
- Four-block layout (RSC, no client JS):
  1. **Header** — breadcrumb (`Papers →`), title (h1), metadata row (venue · year · arXiv link · DOI link · GitHub link) with each external link conditionally rendered.
  2. **TL;DR + Contributions** — verbatim `paper.tldr` (`"[TLDR pending human review]"` sentinel rendered as-is). Contributions table with columns Problem · Benchmark · Metric · Score · Evidence; problem column resolves to `/problems/[slug]` link via `loadPaper`'s join, falls back to monospace slug + `(unresolved)` tag when the slug doesn't resolve (Unit 2.11 cross-link audit will surface these).
  3. **Authors + Institutions** — two-column section. Resolved slugs link to `/authors/[slug]` / `/institutions/[slug]`; unresolved slugs render as monospace `@slug` + `(unresolved)` tag; both-empty empty-states explain the Phase-2 backfill pacing. With all 30 current papers having `authors: []`, every paper currently shows the empty-state on the authors side.
  4. **Citation** — BibTeX-style `<pre>` `@misc{op-paper-<id>, …}` mirroring Unit 1.6's problem-citation block. Includes `eprint` + `archivePrefix` when `arxiv_id` is set; `doi` line when set; `note` for the venue; canonical `{NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/papers/{id}` URL.
- Bundle: build surface jumps **133 → 163 routes** — exactly +30, one prerendered path per paper from Units 2.4 / 2.5 / 2.6. `/papers/[id]` is now `●` SSG at 182 B route code / 106 kB First Load JS, well under §10.4's 180 kB problem-detail budget.
- No new tests required — `loadPaper` is already covered by `lib/content/load-entities.test.ts` (Unit 2.2). Visual regression on a representative paper is deferred to Unit 2.13 (Phase 2 acceptance gate).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (79/79), `pnpm build` (163 routes; bundle sizes unchanged on existing surfaces; First Load JS shared chunk still 103 kB).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.7-paper-detail-page.md`.

#### Unit 2.8 — Papers index `/papers` (replaces Unit 0.10 stub)

- Replaces the Unit 0.10 `StubPage` at `/papers` with a real index that mirrors Unit 1.8's `/problems` index. Server pre-computes `IndexedPaper[]` at build time via [`lib/content/load-papers-index.ts`](../../lib/content/load-papers-index.ts); client island [`components/papers-index/`](../../components/papers-index/index.tsx) owns filter + sort UI.
- `IndexedPaper` shape: `{ id, title, year, venue?, arxivId?, problemSlugs: string[] (distinct from contributions), contributionCount, authorCount, institutionCount }`. Built once at request time; no client-side joins.
- **Filters (3, mutually compose):** Problem slug (distinct slugs across all papers' contributions) · Year (distinct years desc, exact match) · Venue (distinct non-empty venues, alphabetical). "Clear" button resets all three.
- **Sort keys (3):** Year (default, desc) · Title (alpha) · Contributions (count desc — surfaces cross-cutting papers). Sort header doubles as toggle, matching `/problems`.
- **Per row:** title (links to `/papers/[id]`), year (right-aligned mono), venue + arXiv badge + contribution count + author/institution counts on the meta line, clickable problem-slug chips that toggle the Problem filter (same UX as `/problems`' tag chips).
- Tradeoffs flagged in the THINK doc: no author/institution facet yet (all 30 current papers have empty `authors[]` so the facet would be inert); no paper-level "verified" filter (entries land in Unit 2.10); no URL-state encoding (deferred to Phase 3 same as `/problems`).
- Bundle: `/papers` route goes from 161 B / 103 kB (stub) to **1.76 kB / 116 kB First Load JS** — comparable to `/problems` (2.2 kB / 117 kB). Build surface stays at 163 routes; `/papers` is `○` static (filter/sort state is client-side; the data is build-time-resolved).
- No new tests required — `getIndexedPapers` is a thin transformation over the already-tested papers collection. Visual regression baseline for the index lands in Unit 2.13.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (79/79), `pnpm build` (163 routes; only `/papers` bundle changed; First Load JS shared chunk still 103 kB).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.8-papers-index.md`.

#### Unit 2.6b — Institution backfill for Units 2.5 / 2.6 papers

- Phase-2 hygiene follow-on to Units 2.5 / 2.6. Authors 5 new institution YAMLs and backfills `institutions:` arrays on the 6 affected paper YAMLs that landed with `institutions: []`. Shrinks the cross-link audit (Unit 2.11) backlog and adds 5 new SSG paths under `/institutions/[slug]`.
- New institutions (`content/institutions/<slug>.yaml`): `brown-university`, `caltech`, `nvidia`, `huawei`, `instadeep`. All five carry `slug`, `display_name`, `country`, `type` (industry / academic), and `homepage`; `ror_id` deliberately omitted (no fabricated IDs per §15.6 — a follow-on curator pass pulls them from `ror.org`).
- Paper YAML backfills:
  - `1910.03193` (DeepONet) → `brown-university`
  - `2010.08895` (Fourier Neural Operator) → `caltech`
  - `2202.11214` (FourCastNet) → `nvidia`
  - `2211.02556` (Pangu-Weather) → `huawei`
  - `2306.15794` (Nucleotide Transformer) → `instadeep`
  - `2404.06654` (RULER) → `nvidia`
- Build surface goes from 163 → **168 routes** (+5 institution pages now `●` SSG; same 182 B / 106 kB envelope as the existing 9). Total institutions in `content/institutions/`: 9 → **14**.
- No collision with the parallel session's Unit 2.8 (papers index) work — this unit only touches `content/institutions/` (5 new files) and `content/papers/<id>.yaml` (6 modifications), zero overlap with `app/papers/` / `lib/content/load-papers-index.ts` / `components/papers-index/`.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` reports **77 content files** (was 72 after Unit 2.7); `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm build` (168 routes).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6b-institution-backfill.md`.

#### Unit 2.11 — Cross-link audit script (§13 Phase 2 acceptance gate criterion)

- [`scripts/cross-link-audit.ts`](../../scripts/cross-link-audit.ts) (CLI wrapper) + [`lib/content/cross-link-audit.ts`](../../lib/content/cross-link-audit.ts) (testable pure function returning `AuditReport`). Same lib + script split as Unit 0.7's `validate-content`. Wired as `pnpm audit-content`.
- **Seven checks**, four error-class and three warning-class:
  - `paper-problem-fk` (error) — every `paper.contributions[].problem_slug` exists in `content/problems/`.
  - `paper-author-fk` (warning) — every `paper.authors[]` slug resolves to `content/authors/`; warning because Phase-2 norm is empty `authors[]` (Units 2.5/2.6).
  - `paper-institution-fk` (warning) — every `paper.institutions[]` slug resolves; warning because partial population is the Phase-2 norm.
  - `author-institution-fk` (error) — every `author.affiliations[].institution` resolves; small set, must be clean.
  - `related-problems-fk` (error) — every `problem.related_problems[]` slug exists.
  - `related-problems-symmetry` (warning, per Q32) — if A lists B, B should list A; the cardinal rule is the slug resolves, not that the graph is symmetric.
  - `entries-contributions-agreement` (warning) — every `entries.json` entry's `paper_id` should appear in that paper's `contributions[]`; no-op pending Unit 2.10 content but activates automatically.
- **First run against `content/`: 0 errors, 6 warnings.** All 6 warnings are `related-problems-symmetry`: benchmark-integrity ↔ {long-horizon-agent-reliability, hallucination-reduction}, compute-optimal-test-time-reasoning ↔ {hallucination-reduction, long-horizon-agent-reliability}, long-horizon-agent-reliability → scalable-oversight, scalable-oversight → hallucination-reduction. **No dangling slug references** anywhere — Unit 2.6b's institution backfill cleaned the seed papers, Unit 2.4's author backfill cleaned the early paper batch, and the seed problems' `related_problems` slugs all resolve.
- Reads YAML directly from `content/` (no Velite dependency), parallel to the validate-content model. ~66 files read, ~600 ms on the current tree.
- Exit code: 0 if errors == 0 (warnings allowed); 1 otherwise. CI integration lands in Unit 2.13 alongside the Lighthouse + visual-regression refresh.
- No new tests in this unit — fixture-based audit tests are part of Unit 2.13's acceptance-gate test refresh.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.11-cross-link-audit.md`. Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (79/79), `pnpm validate-content` (77 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings).

#### Unit 2.13 — Phase 2 acceptance gate

- **§13 Phase 2 acceptance:** both criteria met. (1) `pnpm audit-content` reports 0 errors / 6 known warnings (all `related-problems-symmetry`, Q32) — green. (2) New visual-regression baselines captured for three Phase-2 routes: `/papers/[id]`, `/authors/[slug]`, `/institutions/[slug]`. The §13 acceptance criteria do not require Units 2.9 / 2.10 / 2.12 (leaderboard / entries / aggregate rollups) — those are *deliverables* in flight, not gate criteria.
- [.github/workflows/ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml): promoted `audit-content` to a CI gate alongside `validate-content`. Job name updated to `typecheck · lint · test · build · validate-content · audit-content`. From this commit forward, paper↔problem reference breakage and asymmetric-author-affiliation breakage block PRs.
- [lighthouserc.json](../../lighthouserc.json): extended the perf/a11y/SEO ≥ 0.95 URL set to cover one representative path per new dynamic route — `/papers/2310.06770` (SWE-bench, Unit 2.4 seed), `/authors/shunyu-yao` (Unit 2.4 seed author), `/institutions/anthropic` (Unit 2.1 seed institution). Total Lighthouse URLs: 6 (was 3 after Unit 1.12).
- [e2e/smoke.spec.ts](../../e2e/smoke.spec.ts):
  - New describe block: "Phase 2 paper detail nav" — visits `/papers/2310.06770` and asserts the §9 four-block layout's stable headings (`h1` title, "Contributions" h2, "Cite this" h2).
  - New describe block: "Phase 2 visual regression: paper + author + institution detail" — three new `toHaveScreenshot` assertions on `<main>` for `/papers/2310.06770`, `/authors/shunyu-yao`, `/institutions/anthropic`. Per-route baselines committed under `e2e/smoke.spec.ts-snapshots/` (chromium / win32). Diff threshold 0.01 (vs. 0.005 for the SVG radar) — page-level snapshots have more font-rendering surface than a pure-SVG figure.
  - Phase-1 RatingRadar baseline preserved verbatim (same maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.005).
- [lib/content/cross-link-audit.test.ts](../../lib/content/cross-link-audit.test.ts): 4 new Vitest cases — real `content/` returns zero errors; the `audit-dangling` fixture surfaces exactly one `paper-problem-fk` error; the `audit-asymmetric` fixture surfaces a `related-problems-symmetry` *warning* (no errors); the `content-valid` fixture (no problems/papers/etc.) tolerates missing subdirs. Two new static fixture trees under [test/fixtures/audit-dangling/](../../test/fixtures/audit-dangling/) and [test/fixtures/audit-asymmetric/](../../test/fixtures/audit-asymmetric/). Total: **83 tests across 15 files** (was 79/14).
- **Phase 2 status at this commit:** gate met; deliverables in flight are Unit 2.9 (per-problem leaderboard), Unit 2.10 (`entries.json` content + Velite collection wiring), Unit 2.12 (aggregate rollups on `/authors/[slug]` cumulative impact and `/institutions/[slug]` ranked subdomain coverage). Phase 3 cannot start until those three units land (§12 cardinal rule).
- Per-platform baseline coupling continues from Unit 1.12: the 4 PNG baselines committed here are `chromium-win32`; the first CI Ubuntu run will need a one-shot `--update-snapshots` to land the Linux equivalents.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (83/83 across 15 files), `pnpm validate-content` (77 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings), `pnpm build` (168 routes, unchanged from Unit 2.11), `pnpm exec playwright test` (7/7 passed in 32.8 s).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.13-phase-2-acceptance-gate.md`.

#### Unit 2.12 — Aggregate rollups (cumulative author + institution impact)

- Closes the §13 Phase 2 deliverable "each author shows cumulative problem-impact score; each institution shows ranked subdomain coverage." Subdomain coverage already shipped in Unit 2.2; this unit lands the cumulative-impact half on both surfaces and adds `problemsTouched` to the institution loader for symmetry with the author one.
- [`lib/content/load-author.ts`](../../lib/content/load-author.ts): `LoadedAuthor.cumulativeImpact?: number` — sum of §8.3 advisory composite scores across `problemsTouched`. Built from `getIndexedProblems()` (Unit 1.8) which already pre-computes per-problem composite from the latest rating action. Undefined when no touched problem has a composite (e.g., no rating action).
- [`lib/content/load-institution.ts`](../../lib/content/load-institution.ts): `LoadedInstitution.problemsTouched: Problem[]` + `LoadedInstitution.cumulativeImpact?: number`. Same shape and semantics as the author loader; deduped via Set over the institution's papers' contributions.
- Page renders:
  - [`/authors/[slug]`](../../app/authors/[slug]/page.tsx): new "Cumulative impact" section at the bottom — shows `cumulativeImpact.toFixed(2)` with denominator "across N problems touched". Falls back to an italic placeholder when undefined. The §8.3 cardinal rule ("composite is advisory and never shown alone") is satisfied by the always-visible problemsTouched section above.
  - [`/institutions/[slug]`](../../app/institutions/[slug]/page.tsx): same section, paired with the existing subdomain-coverage section as the "always alongside" view.
- Sum (not mean) is the §13 wording's "cumulative" reading — more problems touched = more impact. Weighted variants (per-contribution count, per-author share) are explicitly deferred until a real use case requests them.
- [`lib/content/load-entities.test.ts`](../../lib/content/load-entities.test.ts): 3 new Vitest cases — author with rated problemsTouched has positive cumulativeImpact; author with empty problemsTouched returns undefined; institution surfaces both new fields. Total **86 tests across 15 files** (was 83/15).
- No new content, no schema changes, no bundle-size impact (both pages stay at the 182 B / 106 kB First Load JS envelope; the new computation runs at module load against the same Velite snapshot the existing loaders already touch).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.12-aggregate-rollups.md`. Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (86/86), `pnpm validate-content` (77), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings), `pnpm build` (168 routes).

#### Unit 2.9 (+ 2.10 scaffold) — Per-problem leaderboard page

- Combines the two §13 deliverables — "Per-problem leaderboard page with sortable, filterable table; verified-flag rendering" (2.9) and "`entries.json` per problem; per-entry verified flag rendered" (2.10) — into one commit because they're tightly coupled. The page wiring lands here; entries content goes live as curators populate per-problem `entries.json` (§15.6 forbids fabricated benchmark scores, so this commit ships the surface empty).
- Replaces the Unit 0.10 `StubPage` at `/problems/[slug]/leaderboard` with a real SSG page. `generateStaticParams()` over `allProblemSlugs()` prerenders all **10 problem leaderboards**: build surface goes from 168 → **178 routes**.
- Page layout: breadcrumb (`Problems / <problem> / Leaderboard`) → one-paragraph source-provenance note (§10.2) → per-benchmark sortable table OR an empty-state block. Sort defaults to `score` desc when the parent benchmark is `higher-is-better`, asc when `lower-is-better`; date is the secondary sort key.
- Verified-flag pill (§13 deliverable wording): `verified: true` renders as a green chart-2-tinted "verified" chip; `verified: false` renders as a muted "unverified" chip. Both monospace, tracking-wide.
- New file [`lib/content/load-entries.ts`](../../lib/content/load-entries.ts) — `loadEntriesForProblem(slug)` reads `content/problems/<slug>/entries.json` if present, validates each entry against `LeaderboardEntrySchema`, returns `[]` when missing. Reads via `node:fs` directly (mirrors validate-content + cross-link-audit's pattern); a Velite `entries` collection is deferred until content warrants it.
- All 10 leaderboard pages currently render the empty-state block (no `entries.json` files exist on disk yet). Phase-3 ratings-dynamics units or a curator-driven leaderboard-entry workflow populate them; the cross-link audit's `entries-contributions-agreement` check activates automatically.
- Tradeoffs flagged: per §15.6 the page ships empty; the §13 acceptance gate (Unit 2.13) was not contingent on this content. With this commit, **all 13 units of the 2.0 Phase-2 plan are now done** (2.0–2.13, plus the 2.6b hygiene unit). Phase 3 (§12) can begin once you sign off on Phase 2.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (86/86), `pnpm validate-content` (77 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings), `pnpm build` (178 routes; the +10 over Unit 2.12 are the 10 leaderboard pages SSG-prerendered).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.9-leaderboard-page.md`.

#### Unit 2.6c — ROR ID backfill for Unit-2.6b institutions

- Closes the explicit deferral in Unit 2.6b ("`ror_id` deliberately omitted (no fabricated IDs per §15.6 — a follow-on curator pass pulls them from `ror.org`)"). This is that pass.
- Adds the `ror_id:` field to 4 of the 5 institutions seeded in Unit 2.6b. Each ID was retrieved from the ROR public API (`https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations?query=...`) and cross-checked against the organization's location and founding year on the matching record:
  - `brown-university` → [`05gq02987`](https://ror.org/05gq02987) (Brown University, Providence RI, est. 1764)
  - `caltech` → [`05dxps055`](https://ror.org/05dxps055) (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena CA, est. 1891)
  - `nvidia` → [`03jdj4y14`](https://ror.org/03jdj4y14) (NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara CA, est. 1993 — parent record)
  - `huawei` → [`00cmhce21`](https://ror.org/00cmhce21) (Huawei Technologies (China), Shenzhen — parent record)
- **InstaDeep is a documented exception**: ROR v2 search returns `number_of_results: 0` for both the plain-query and `names.value`-advanced search variants. The organization is not registered with ROR (a known gap in ROR's coverage of private AI/ML startups). Per §15.6, `ror_id` is left omitted on `instadeep.yaml` rather than fabricated; a future content commit can add it if and when ROR registers InstaDeep.
- All 4 added IDs satisfy the strict regex in `lib/schemas/institution.ts` (`^0[\da-z]{6}\d{2}$`): 9-character format with leading `0`, six alphanumeric-lowercase, trailing 2 digits. `pnpm validate-content` enforces this at commit time.
- Scope intentionally limited to the 5 institutions named in Unit 2.6b's deferral. The other 9 pre-2.6b institutions (`anthropic`, `google-deepmind`, `meta-fair`, `microsoft-research`, `mit`, `openai`, `princeton-university`, `stanford-university`, `uc-berkeley`) also lack `ror_id`; a separate hygiene unit (call it 2.6d) can extend the same pattern across them if a future audit asks for it.
- No code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Pure metadata addition. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (77 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected `related-problems-symmetry` set), `pnpm build` (178 routes; all 14 `/institutions/[slug]` pages prerender).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6c-ror-id-backfill.md`.

#### Unit 2.6d — ROR ID backfill for original-9 institutions

- Extends Unit 2.6c's pattern across the 9 institutions seeded in Unit 2.1 without `ror_id`. Combined with 2.6c, 11 of 14 institutions now carry a verified ROR ID.
- Adds the `ror_id:` field to 7 of the 9 institutions. Each ID was retrieved from the ROR public API (`https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations?query=...`) and cross-checked against the organization's location and founding year on the matching record:
  - `anthropic` → [`056y0v115`](https://ror.org/056y0v115) (Anthropic, San Francisco CA, est. 2021)
  - `openai` → [`05wx9n238`](https://ror.org/05wx9n238) (OpenAI, San Francisco CA, est. 2015)
  - `google-deepmind` → [`00971b260`](https://ror.org/00971b260) (Google DeepMind, London UK, est. 2010 — parent Alphabet)
  - `mit` → [`042nb2s44`](https://ror.org/042nb2s44) (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge MA, est. 1861)
  - `stanford-university` → [`00f54p054`](https://ror.org/00f54p054) (Stanford University, est. 1891)
  - `uc-berkeley` → [`01an7q238`](https://ror.org/01an7q238) (University of California, Berkeley, est. 1868)
  - `princeton-university` → [`00hx57361`](https://ror.org/00hx57361) (Princeton University, est. 1746)
- **2 documented exceptions** (consistent with Unit 2.6c's InstaDeep precedent — omit rather than misattribute):
  - `meta-fair` — Meta FAIR is not separately registered in ROR. Parent Meta has `01zbnvs85`, but attaching a parent-corporate ROR ID to a research-division slug ("Meta FAIR") is a category error future tooling would propagate. Omit.
  - `microsoft-research` — Microsoft Research has no unified ROR record at the lab level; only regional MSR subsidiaries (UK, India, Asia, etc.) and parent Microsoft (`00d0nc645`) are registered. Same reasoning. Omit.
- All 7 added IDs satisfy the schema regex `^0[\da-z]{6}\d{2}$` (9 chars). `pnpm validate-content` enforces at commit time.
- Combined with 2.6c, **3 of 14 institutions** still lack `ror_id` (`instadeep`, `meta-fair`, `microsoft-research`). All 3 are documented-exception omissions, not deferrals.
- Pure metadata addition: no code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (191 files — includes 114 new author YAMLs from a parallel session's in-flight Unit 2.5b work), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected set), `pnpm build` (178 routes).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6d-ror-id-backfill-original-institutions.md`.

#### Unit 2.5b — Author backfill for Unit-2.5 papers (batch 2)

- Closes one half of the Phase-2 follow-on flagged in the session handoff and explicitly deferred by Unit 2.5 ("Authors stay `[]` … the authors of these 10 papers don't have slugs yet … Backfilling lands in a later Phase-2 unit when more authors are minted"). The other half (Unit 2.6 papers, batch 3) ships in a sibling unit.
- Adds 114 new `content/authors/<slug>.yaml` files — every previously-missing author across the 10 batch-2 papers. Author count: **12 → 126**. Each YAML follows the established three-line shape (`slug`, `display_name`, `affiliations: []`) — no fabricated ORCIDs, scholar IDs, homepages, or affiliations (§15.6; same restraint that kept ROR IDs out of Unit 2.6b until Unit 2.6c/2.6d had verified pulls).
- Attestation: every author list was pulled from `https://arxiv.org/abs/<id>` via WebFetch and copied verbatim, including the long Anthropic author list (46 authors) on `2211.03540` *Measuring Progress on Scalable Oversight*. Slugs are ASCII kebab-case per `lib/schemas/_primitives.slug` regex; diacritics are ASCII-folded in slugs (`heinrich-kuttler`, `tim-rocktaschel`, `adria-garriga-alonso`, `kamile-lukosiute`, `noemi-mercado`, `jurgen-schmidhuber`) but preserved verbatim in `display_name` (UTF-8, no BOM, LF).
- Reuses 2 existing author slugs from the Unit 2.1 seed: `dario-amodei` (papers `1805.00899` + `2211.03540`) and `jacob-steinhardt` (paper `2211.00593`). 3 minted slugs are shared across multiple batch-2 papers: `ethan-perez` (RAG + Anthropic oversight), `arthur-conmy` (IOI + ACDC), `samuel-r-bowman` (Anthropic oversight + GPQA) — minted once, referenced twice.
- Updates all 10 batch-2 paper YAMLs (`1805.00899`, `2005.11401`, `2211.00593`, `2211.03540`, `2304.14997`, `2308.00352`, `2308.11432`, `2309.08600`, `2311.12022`, `2404.06654`): `authors: []` → full publication-order list. The cross-link audit's `danglingPaperAuthorRefs` line now meaningfully covers ~130 paper→author edges (was vacuously 0 because arrays were empty).
- No code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Pure content addition. Velite re-emits `.velite/authors.json` with 126 entries; the existing `/authors/[slug]` route automatically prerenders the 114 new pages on the next `pnpm build`.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (**191 files**, was 77), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected `related-problems-symmetry` set; `0 dangling author refs` is now substantive rather than vacuous), `pnpm test` (86/86 across 15 files), `pnpm typecheck` clean.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.5b-author-backfill.md`.
- **Commit partition (workflow note).** The unit lands in 2 commits — `chore(phase-2): unit 2.5b/1` (114 author YAMLs) and `chore(phase-2): unit 2.5b/2` (paper-side `authors[]` wiring + THINK doc + this CHANGELOG entry). Reason: the lint-staged + prettier pre-commit hook fails on Windows when 126 file paths are passed in a single argv (the cumulative path-string exceeds the cmd.exe ~8KB limit). Splitting keeps each `prettier --write` invocation comfortably under the limit. The two commits are atomic for review purposes — neither is independently meaningful; both must land for the audit's `danglingPaperAuthorRefs` line to remain green.

#### Unit 2.6g — Paper title audit + canonicalization fix for 2305.10160

- Phase-2 hygiene follow-on. Triggered by Unit 2.6e's HyenaDNA finding (arXiv-ID-vs-claimed-title mismatch on `2306.15794`); ran a corpus-wide title audit across all 30 paper YAMLs and found one additional canonicalization bug beyond the HyenaDNA case.
- **The fix**: `content/papers/2305.10160.yaml` title `"...Mitigating Data Contamination by Large Language Models"` → `"...Mitigating Data Contamination by Evaluation Benchmarks"`. Same paper (Jacovi, Caciularu, Goldman, Goldberg; EMNLP 2023); the previous subtitle was a paraphrase error introduced when the paper was seeded in Unit 2.6 — "by Evaluation Benchmarks" identifies the mechanism (benchmarks themselves leak into pretraining corpora and contaminate), "by Large Language Models" mis-attributes the agency. Verified against both the arXiv API (batched call from this session) and the `https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10160` HTML page (single fetch).
- **Audit coverage in this session**:
  - **Batch 2 (Unit 2.5, 10 papers)** — arXiv-verified via API batched call. All 10 titles match YAML.
  - **Batch 3 (Unit 2.6, 10 papers)** — arXiv-verified via API batched call. 2 mismatches found: `2306.15794` (HyenaDNA; yielded to parallel-session Unit 2.6e), `2305.10160` (fixed in this commit).
  - **Batch 1 (Unit 2.4, 10 papers)** — arXiv API returned `429 Too Many Requests` (rate-limit from the batch-2/3 burst). Audit fell back to recall-checks against well-known references; no mismatches found, but this leg is **not arXiv-verified**. A future hygiene unit should re-run the API audit on the 10 batch-1 IDs once the rate-limit cooldown clears.
- **Unit numbering note**: `2.6f` is deliberately left unclaimed as the likely home for a batch-3 author-backfill unit (mirror of the parallel session's Unit 2.5b for batch 2). This unit uses `2.6g` to avoid colliding with that future work. The parallel-session Unit 2.6e (HyenaDNA correction) is pending in the working tree at commit time and will land separately.
- Pure metadata fix: no code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (191 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected set).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6g-paper-title-audit.md`.

#### Unit 2.6h — Leaderboard entries for hallucination-reduction (SimpleQA only)

- Phase-2 hygiene follow-on. Closes one corner of the §13 deliverable "`entries.json` per problem; per-entry verified flag rendered" deferred by Unit 2.9 ("page wiring lands here; entries content goes live as curators populate per-problem `entries.json`"). Lands the first per-problem `entries.json` content into the repo.
- **Scope-limited to 3 SimpleQA entries** sourced from [`openai/simple-evals`](https://github.com/openai/simple-evals) (OpenAI's official evaluation harness for the SimpleQA benchmark, primary-source-grade for OpenAI-attested scores):
  - `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` → **40.1** (2024-08-06; model snapshot date embedded in the model name)
  - `o1` → **42.6** (2024-12-05; OpenAI's public-availability date for o1)
  - `gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27` → **62.5** (2025-02-27; the current top scorer in the simple-evals table)
- All 3 entries set `verified: true` qualified by the leaderboard page's [inclusive-OR definition](../../app/problems/[slug]/leaderboard/page.tsx#L62-L64) — "Verified entries have been replicated or have explicit protocol notes". The OpenAI-sourced scores are not independently replicated but each entry carries explicit `protocol_notes` pointing to the simple-evals repo and the correct/incorrect/not_attempted protocol defined in paper 2411.04368.
- Score scale: percentages (0–100), preserving the primary source's reported format verbatim (§15.6 defensible default; the benchmark declaration in `problem.yaml` doesn't pin a scale).
- **3 of 4 declared benchmarks remain empty** (documented in the THINK doc):
  - `truthfulqa-2026` — TruthfulQA abstract reports "truthful 58%" but the benchmark's declared metric is `truthful+informative` (a stricter conjunction; ~21% in the paper's body). Abstract-only fetch is metric-mismatched; full-PDF curation is needed. Additionally, `-2026` suffix implies a hypothetical refresh of the 2021 benchmark; that disambiguation is a separate curatorial decision.
  - `halueval` — HaluEval abstract is methodological only. Headline numbers are in the paper's tables; full-PDF or [`RUCAIBox/HaluEval`](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval) leaderboard ingestion would unblock.
  - `facts-grounding` — FACTS Grounding is a 2024 DeepMind benchmark with no contributing paper in the repo. A future paper-ingest commit attaches.
- No code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB. The `/problems/hallucination-reduction/leaderboard` page now renders 3 entries on the `simpleqa` benchmark instead of empty-state across the board.
- **Schema gap surfaced** (for Phase-3 work): `LeaderboardEntrySchema` lacks `model_name` and `score_scale`. Today's `paper_id` field serves dual duty (benchmark-defining paper + score-reporting paper) — `protocol_notes` carries the model identity. A Phase-3 schema refinement could split these out.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (192 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected set), `pnpm build` (178 routes; new `entries.json` doesn't add SSG paths).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6h-entries-hallucination-reduction.md`.

#### Unit 2.6i — Leaderboard entries for long-horizon-agent-reliability (τ-bench only)

- Phase-2 hygiene follow-on, sibling to Unit 2.6h. Extends the per-problem `entries.json` pattern to the second-most-populated problem in the repo (4 contributing papers, 4 declared benchmarks; 1-to-1 paper↔benchmark mapping). Lands 3 attested entries.
- **Scope-limited to 3 τ-bench `pass^4` entries** sourced from the [`sierra-research/tau-bench`](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau-bench) README leaderboard tables (Sierra is Shunyu Yao's org and the authoring organization for paper 2406.12045 — primary-source-grade for the benchmark's own numbers):
  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` on **retail** → **0.462**
  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` on **airline** → **0.225**
  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` on **retail** → **0.387**
- **Metric selection**: `pass^4` — the highest k reported uniformly across rows in the README and the regime the problem.yaml notes pin as the "central artefact" (the pass^1 → pass^k collapse). Shipping the easier `pass^1` column would undercut the problem's editorial framing.
- All 3 entries set `verified: true` qualified by the leaderboard page's [inclusive-OR definition](app/problems/[slug]/leaderboard/page.tsx#L62-L64); each `protocol_notes` field carries model variant, domain, strategy (TC = tool-calling per 2406.12045), the source URL, and the metric. Scores are Sierra-attested, not independently replicated.
- Score scale: decimals (0–1), preserving the README's verbatim format (§15.6 defensible default; consistent with 2.6h's "preserve primary-source format" precedent — OpenAI reports percentages, Sierra reports decimals).
- **3 of 4 declared benchmarks remain empty** (documented in the THINK doc with unblocking conditions):
  - `swe-bench-verified` — [swebench.com](https://www.swebench.com/) leaderboard is JS-rendered; `WebFetch` returns the static shell only. A Phase-5 leaderboard-ingest tool with a headless browser would unblock.
  - `osworld` — paper abstract DOES attest "best model 12.24%, human 72.36%" but the score lacks model-name attribution; the schema's `protocol_notes` would render "best model (unspecified) — 12.24%" which is editorially weak. Full-PDF read or the [os-world.github.io](https://os-world.github.io/) JS-rendered leaderboard would resolve.
  - `re-bench` — METR paper abstract reports only ratios ("4× human at 2h budget", "0.5× human at 32h"). Schema requires `score: z.number()`, not a ratio; mismatched with the declared `success-rate` metric. Full-PDF table read would unblock.
- `entries-contributions-agreement` audit check (warning-class, [lib/content/cross-link-audit.ts:273-292](lib/content/cross-link-audit.ts#L273-L292)) passes — paper 2406.12045 declares `contributions[0]: { problem_slug: long-horizon-agent-reliability, benchmark_id: tau-bench }`, matching every entry.
- No code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB. The `/problems/long-horizon-agent-reliability/leaderboard` page now renders 3 entries on the `tau-bench` benchmark instead of empty-state across the board.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (193 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected set), `pnpm build` (178 routes; new `entries.json` doesn't add SSG paths), `pnpm test` (86/86).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6i-entries-long-horizon-agent-reliability.md`.

#### Unit 2.6e — HyenaDNA correction for paper 2306.15794

- Phase-2 hygiene follow-on, **completing parallel-session work that was stranded mid-flight across 4 intervening commits** (2.6h, 2.6i, 3.0, 3.1). The THINK doc and YAML diff were authored by the parallel session in an earlier hour of the multi-curator session; this commit ships them as-is after re-verifying the diff and running gates. Fixes a data-integrity bug surfaced by Unit 2.6d's ROR backfill: paper YAML at arXiv ID `2306.15794` claimed to be "The Nucleotide Transformer" (Dalla-Torre et al., InstaDeep) but the actual paper at that arXiv ID is **HyenaDNA** (Nguyen et al., Stanford / UC Berkeley / Mila).
- `WebFetch` on `https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794` (parallel session, earlier in this session) confirmed the actual paper at that ID. Unit 2.6 seed conflated the two papers.
- The fix (single file, [content/papers/2306.15794.yaml](content/papers/2306.15794.yaml)):
  - `title` → HyenaDNA's verbatim title: "HyenaDNA: Long-Range Genomic Sequence Modeling at Single Nucleotide Resolution"
  - `tldr` → describes HyenaDNA's contribution (Hyena long-convolution operator; single-nucleotide resolution; contexts up to ~1M tokens)
  - `institutions`: `[instadeep]` → `[stanford-university, uc-berkeley]` (both pre-existing in `content/institutions/` from Unit 2.1; Mila intentionally omitted because no Mila institution slug exists yet)
  - `contributions[0]`: drops `benchmark_id: rare-variant-zero-shot` and `metric: spearman` — HyenaDNA did not introduce the rare-variant-zero-shot benchmark (the Nucleotide Transformer did); `problem_slug: genome-foundation-models` and `evidence:` URL remain valid
  - `authors: []` preserved, matching the other 9 batch-3 papers' pattern; uniform batch-3 author backfill (the still-reserved Unit 2.6f) will pick up HyenaDNA's 13-author arXiv list captured in the THINK doc
- **Surfaced findings** (for future curator):
  - `content/institutions/instadeep.yaml` is now **orphan** — no paper in the repo references it after this commit. Audit doesn't flag orphan institutions; re-attached on a future Nucleotide-Transformer paper commit (bioRxiv `10.1101/2023.01.11.523679`).
  - `rare-variant-zero-shot` benchmark in `genome-foundation-models/problem.yaml` now has **no contributing paper** — benchmark declaration stays (editorial intent independent of contributors), leaderboard page renders empty for it until a Nucleotide-Transformer paper is added.
  - HyenaDNA's NeurIPS 2023 venue was not added (`venue: arXiv 2023` retained) — arXiv abstract pages don't attest venue; defer until a primary-source venue claim lands.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files; Phase-3 rating-action YAMLs raised the count from 193), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected set; my changes don't introduce dangling refs because both new institution slugs exist).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/2.6e-hyenadna-correction.md` (parallel-session-authored).

### Phase 3 — Rating Dynamics & Trending

#### Unit 3.0 — Phase 3 prep (THINK doc + Phase-3 unit breakdown + OPEN_QUESTIONS surface)

- Phase 2 → Phase 3 gate cleared: human sign-off granted per §12 cardinal rule. Phase 2 closed at HEAD ≈ `1d9d67e` (12 of the 13 planned Phase-2 units committed, plus 6 hygiene follow-ons: `2.6b/c/d/g/h/i` and `2.5b`). The §13 Phase 2 acceptance criteria — `cross-link-audit` green, visual baselines captured, 30-paper floor met — remain met.
- This unit is docs-only. Lands [`docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md`](docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md) with:
  - **14-unit breakdown for Phase 3** (3.0 through 3.13), mirroring the 13–14 unit shape of Phases 0/1/2.
  - **8 Phase-3-blocking decisions resolved with defensible defaults** (D-1 multi-action problem set, D-2 dating cadence, D-3 action content scope, D-4 JSON envelope, D-5 RSS shape, D-6 Recompose URL params, D-7 history page composition, D-8 trending window).
  - **2 decisions deferred to per-unit implementation** (D-9 SaturationCurve x-axis & data source, D-10 RatingHistoryStream stepped-vs-linear).
- **Phase 3 deliverables** (verbatim from §13): second + third rating actions for ≥ 5 seed problems; per-problem `/ratings` sub-page; global `/ratings` feed (HTML + JSON + RSS); `SaturationCurve` + `MoversBoard` + `RatingHistoryStream` vizes; "Recompose" UI control. Acceptance gate: table-fallback toggles on every viz; RSS validates (W3C); Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95.
- **OPEN_QUESTIONS.md updates**:
  - Q18 (Saturation N/A encoding) — added forward-pointer: resolution scheduled in Unit 3.11 (ADR-0006).
  - **Q32** added as a resolved retro-entry — `related_problems[]` symmetry is warning-class not error-class, decided in Unit 2.11. Documented in the file for the first time (was referenced in commit text + session memory but not in OPEN_QUESTIONS.md proper).
  - **Q33** added: RSS `<dc:creator>` / `<managingEditor>` shape — blocks Unit 3.5.
  - **Q34** added: Watchlist signal in simulated revisions — blocks Unit 3.7 rendering coverage.
  - **Q35** added: Recompose UI persistence to localStorage — Phase-3 lean: defer.
  - **Q36** added: Recompose UI scope (just `/problems` vs cross-page) — Phase-3 lean: `/problems` only.
- **Parallel-curator note**: this unit ships docs only, no collision risk. Subsequent Phase 3 units must `git status --short` before starting; Unit 3.1 in particular touches `content/problems/<slug>/ratings/` for 5 problems and is ADR-0005-immutable (new files only).
- Pure docs addition: no code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB. No smoke-gate run necessary beyond existing CI.
- THINK artifact: [`docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md`](docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md).

#### Unit 3.1 — Simulated multi-action rating histories for 5 seed problems

- Phase 3 deliverable (§13): "Second and third rating actions for at least 5 seed problems (simulate revisions across past months)". The only deliverable that meaningfully exercises ADR-0005's append-only flow — must ship before the Phase-3 visualisations have multi-action histories to render against.
- **10 new rating-action YAMLs** (2 per problem × 5 problems), file-per-action per ADR-0005:
  - `hallucination-reduction/ratings/2026-09-01-q3-revision.yaml` + `2026-12-15-q4-revision.yaml`
  - `long-horizon-agent-reliability/ratings/2026-09-01-q3-revision.yaml` + `2026-12-15-q4-revision.yaml`
  - `scalable-oversight/ratings/2026-09-01-q3-revision.yaml` + `2026-12-15-q4-revision.yaml`
  - `compute-optimal-test-time-reasoning/ratings/2026-09-01-q3-revision.yaml` + `2026-12-15-q4-revision.yaml`
  - `mechanistic-interpretability/ratings/2026-09-01-q3-revision.yaml` + `2026-12-15-q4-revision.yaml`
- **Each action is a complete dimension snapshot** per §8.5 (the file-per-action format requires all 5 dimensions on every entry, even unchanged). `prior_action` field on every revision points to the previous action by `<problem-slug>/<filename-without-extension>` per Unit 3.0 D-4.
- **Forward-dated quarterly cadence** per Unit 3.0 D-2: initial (2026-05-14, existing) → q3 (2026-09-01) → q4 (2026-12-15). Backdating wasn't an option: the initial is dated 1 day before today's harness wall-clock, and ADR-0005 forbids editing existing files.
- **Per-action delta is modest and signal-driven** per Unit 3.0 D-3 (1–2 dimensions changed substantively per revision; `signals_considered` includes at least one new entry vs. the prior action):
  - `hallucination-reduction`: q3 saturation 35 → 32 (SimpleQA / HaluEval-QA leaderboard refresh); q4 confidence-only updates.
  - `long-horizon-agent-reliability`: q3 / q4 confidence-only updates on difficulty + saturation + urgency + industry-call; values held while signal base hardens (τ-bench domain expansion, RE-Bench v2 announcement).
  - `scalable-oversight`: q3 confidence lifts on difficulty + saturation; q4 saturation 18 → 22 on two 2026-Q4 sandwich-experiment results. Watchlist remains `true` (per Unit 1.x initial).
  - `compute-optimal-test-time-reasoning`: q3 saturation 35 → 30 (inverse-scaling regime widened; ceiling reframed); q4 industry-call confidence 0.70 → 0.80.
  - `mechanistic-interpretability`: q3 saturation 25 → 28 (SAE circuit-recovery progress); q4 industry-call confidence 0.60 → 0.55 and **watchlist `false` → `true`** — the Phase-3-coverage flip per Q34 lean, triggered by a 2026-Q4 frontier-lab reassessment questioning whether SAE feature inventories translate to production auditing on the implied timeline.
- **Methodology version pinned to v1.0.0** for all 10 revisions. ADR-0006 (Saturation N/A encoding; Q18 resolution) is scheduled for Unit 3.11 with a v1.1 bump; existing v1.0.0 actions remain valid per §8.1 ("a rating produced under v1.0 is never silently re-graded by v1.1").
- **Sources cited in `signals_considered`** trace to either (a) committed papers in `content/papers/` (e.g., SimpleQA 2411.04368, τ-bench 2406.12045, Snell/Kumar 2408.03314) or (b) plausible-but-unwritten 2026-Q2 / Q3 / Q4 follow-on works framed as field-level signals. The latter is the §15.6 boundary — Unit 3.1 is "simulated revisions" per §13's verbatim wording, and the rationales are framed as the curator's tracking-the-field summary rather than precise paper citations. A future per-action backfill could replace each signals entry with a paper slug once the corresponding 2026 papers are seeded.
- **Pre-commit hook compatibility verified**: the ADR-0005 immutability check blocks edits/deletes to existing `content/problems/*/ratings/*.yaml` files but permits new additions. This unit adds 10 new files; no existing files are modified.
- Pure content addition: no code, schema, route, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB. Velite re-emits `.velite/ratings.json` with 20 entries (was 10) on the next `pnpm build`.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm validate-content` (**203 files**, was 193), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32-expected `related-problems-symmetry` set).
- THINK artifact: covered in [`docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md`](docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md) §D-1 / D-2 / D-3; no separate Unit-3.1 THINK doc (D-1 through D-3 enumerated every per-action decision).

#### Unit 3.2 — Cross-problem rating-action loader (`lib/content/load-ratings.ts`)

- Phase-3 foundation. Backs the per-problem `/ratings` sub-page (Unit 3.3), the global `/ratings` HTML feed (Unit 3.4), the `/api/v1/ratings` + `/api/v1/rss.xml` feeds (Unit 3.5), the `/trending` MoversBoard window-filtering (Unit 3.7), and the `SaturationCurve` / `RatingHistoryStream` data shaping (Units 3.6, 3.8, 3.9). Single loader prevents three+ pages from each rolling their own.
- **velite.config.ts change**: `RatingActionS` now carries a stable `id` field derived via the `s.path()` transform (same pattern as `methodology` and `problemPages` collections). Form: `<problem_slug>/<filename-without-extension>` per Unit 3.0 D-4. Used as RSS `<guid>`, JSON envelope identifier, and URL fragment for per-action deep links. No breaking change — the existing fields (`problem_slug`, `date`, `methodology_version`, `curator`, `prior_action`, `dimensions`, `signals_considered`, `watchlist`) are preserved; `path` + `id` are additive. `lib/schemas/rating-action.ts` (the Zod-4 source of truth) is untouched — the Velite-side transform is a presentation enhancement, not a data-shape change (Q31 contract holds).
- **Loader API** (`lib/content/load-ratings.ts`):
  - `allRatingActions()` — every action across all problems, sorted newest-first.
  - `ratingActionsForProblem(slug)` — actions for one problem, sorted newest-first.
  - `ratingActionById(id)` — stable lookup by Velite-injected id.
  - `recentRatingActions(windowDays = 90, anchorDate?)` — actions inside a date window. **Anchor defaults to the most-recent action date across the corpus**, NOT today's wall-clock (per Unit 3.0 D-8 — keeps `/trending` showing relative motion against simulated data rather than emptying when wall-clock outruns the data). Anchor is inclusive on both ends: `cutoff ≤ action.date ≤ anchor`.
  - `diffRatingAction(action, prior)` — computes a `RatingActionDiff` with per-dimension `RatingActionDelta` entries. Flags both categorical (grade / value / stars) changes and confidence shifts ≥ `CONFIDENCE_DELTA_THRESHOLD` (0.05). Tags one delta as `primary: true` — the first non-confidence-only delta, falling back to the first delta when every change is confidence-only. Returns `watchlistChanged` + `priorWatchlist` + `newWatchlist` for MoversBoard's watchlist-add signal (Unit 3.7).
- **Test coverage** (`lib/content/load-ratings.test.ts`, 19 tests):
  - `allRatingActions` shape + count (20 = 10 initials + 10 q3/q4 revisions) + sort order + id regex.
  - `ratingActionsForProblem` — multi-action problem (hallucination-reduction → 3 actions in q4 / q3 / initial order), single-action problem (benchmark-integrity → 1), unknown slug.
  - `ratingActionById` — initial (no prior_action), revision (prior_action set), unknown id.
  - `recentRatingActions` — default 90-day window (q4 cohort = 5), 180-day (q3 + q4 = 10), 365-day (everything = 20), explicit anchor 2026-09-30 with 60-day window (q3 only = 5).
  - `diffRatingAction` — initial returns empty deltas, hallucination-reduction q3 vs initial flags `saturation 35 → 32` as primary, mechanistic-interpretability q4 vs q3 detects watchlist `false → true`, scalable-oversight q4 vs q3 detects `saturation 18 → 22`, confidence-only diffs carry the "confidence" substring.
- **Type derivation**: `export type RatingAction = (typeof ratings)[number]` — re-uses Velite's emitted type, automatically picks up the new `id` field. Downstream consumers (`load-problem.ts`, `load-problems-index.ts`) get the new field for free without code changes.
- No new schema, route, or bundle additions. Build surface unchanged at **178 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm test` (**105/105 across 16 files**, was 86/86; +19 new tests in this unit), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32 set), `pnpm typecheck` clean.
- THINK artifact: covered in [`docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md`](docs/thinking/3.0-phase-3-prep.md) Unit-3.2 row; the velite.config.ts id-injection is described inline above (Q31-contract-preserving Velite-side transform).

#### Unit 3.3 — Per-problem `/problems/[slug]/ratings` sub-page

- Phase-3 deliverable (§13). Replaces the Unit 1.x StubPage at `/problems/[slug]/ratings` with a real SSG page rendering the full rating-action history for the problem. Reads from Unit 3.2's `ratingActionsForProblem(slug)` + `diffRatingAction(action, prior)` loaders.
- **Layout per action** (newest-first `<ol>`):
  - Breadcrumb `Problems / <problem> / Rating actions` and page header.
  - One `<article>` per action with stable anchor id `#<filename-without-extension>` for deep linking from the global feed (Unit 3.4) and RSS items (Unit 3.5).
  - Header: ISO date, "Initial action" vs "Revision" tag, curator, methodology version pill, **WATCH** pill when `watchlist: true`.
  - Diff summary block: per-dimension `RatingActionDelta.summary` lines (e.g. `saturation 35 → 32`, `urgency ★4 → ★5`, `difficulty confidence 0.65 → 0.70`). The `primary: true` delta is rendered with the cyan-accent pill; secondaries are muted-mono. Confidence-delta side-note on every non-confidence-only delta.
  - Watchlist transition line when `diff.watchlistChanged` (`watchlist false → true`).
  - **5 dimension cards in a 2-column grid** — Difficulty (letter grade), Saturation (0–100), Urgency / Value / Industry Call (★ / ☆ ASCII stars 0–5). Each card renders the headline value + confidence (decimal) + the full rationale string with `whitespace-pre-line` so the multi-line YAML literals render with paragraph breaks intact.
  - Signals-considered bullet list when the action has any.
- **`generateStaticParams()`** prerenders all 10 problem slugs. Build surface: **178 → 188 routes** (+10 SSG paths). The page was previously `ƒ` (dynamic stub); it's now `●` (SSG). First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- **A11y notes** (in preparation for the Phase-3 acceptance gate's a11y ≥ 95 requirement):
  - Semantic landmarks: `<main>`, `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">`, `<ol aria-label="Rating actions, newest first">`, `<section aria-label="...">` per region, `<article aria-labelledby="heading-...">` per action.
  - Anchor ids on `<li>` use `scroll-mt-20` so deep-link jumps don't tuck the header under the site chrome.
  - `<time datetime>` for every machine-readable date.
  - The cyan-accent "primary delta" pill uses `--color-chart-2` (Unit 0.4 design tokens), AA-contrast against `--background`.
- **No vizes on this page** — Phase 3 acceptance gate's "table-fallback toggles" requirement applies to chart components (Units 3.6 / 3.7 / 3.8 / 3.9), not to text-rendering pages. This page is naturally a table-shaped surface.
- **Test coverage**: rendering is exercised by the SSG build (188 routes prerender clean). No Vitest unit test added — Phase-1 / Phase-2 page-level testing convention is Playwright e2e (out of scope for this unit; e2e baselines refresh in Unit 3.13 acceptance gate).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (188 routes, +10 from 178; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB).

#### Unit 3.4 — `/ratings` global HTML feed

- Phase-3 deliverable (§13: "`/ratings` global feed (HTML + JSON + RSS)"). This unit ships the HTML view. JSON + RSS land in Unit 3.5.
- Replaces the Unit 1.x StubPage at `app/ratings/page.tsx` with a static feed page reading `allRatingActions()` from Unit 3.2's loader. Renders newest-first across **all** problems (not scoped to one) — the rating-agency public "action tape" framing from §3.1 / §8.5.
- **Each feed entry** (compact line per `RatingAction`):
  - Metadata line: ISO date, curator, methodology version (font-mono).
  - Problem title as link to `/problems/<slug>/ratings#<filename-without-extension>` — deep-link anchors land on the matching `<article>` in Unit 3.3's per-problem ratings page.
  - "revision" vs "initial action" tag.
  - Primary delta pill (cyan `--color-chart-2`) showing the headline change (e.g. `saturation 35 → 32`). Falls back to "Initial action — no prior to diff against" or "Rationale-only refresh (no dimensional change)".
  - Watchlist transition pill (`--color-chart-3`) when `diff.watchlistChanged`.
- **Subscribe links**: header carries `RSS` → `/api/v1/rss.xml` and `JSON` → `/api/v1/ratings`. Both targets are 501-stub routes today (from Unit 1.7-ish API scaffolding); Unit 3.5 makes them real.
- **Page renders as `○` Static** (no `generateStaticParams` needed; no dynamic params). Build surface unchanged at **188 routes** (the `/ratings` slot was already counted as a stub). First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- **A11y notes** (for Phase-3 acceptance gate):
  - Semantic landmarks: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<ol aria-label="Rating actions feed">`, `<article>` per entry.
  - `<time datetime>` for the machine-readable date.
  - `metadata.title` + `metadata.description` set for the route — feeds into the document head.
  - Divider via Tailwind `divide-y` on the `<ol>` rather than CSS-only horizontal rules — preserves the semantic list while visually separating entries.
- **No vizes** — same reasoning as Unit 3.3; this is a text-shaped surface.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (188 routes; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB).

#### Unit 3.5 — `/api/v1/ratings` JSON + `/api/v1/rss.xml` RSS feeds

- Phase-3 deliverable (§13: "`/ratings` global feed (HTML + JSON + RSS)"). Replaces the Phase-0 / Phase-1 501 stubs at both endpoints with real implementations. Both routes are marked `export const dynamic = "force-static"` so they prerender at build time and serve from CDN — same envelope on every request until content changes and the next build runs.
- **JSON envelope** at `/api/v1/ratings` (hybrid per Q25 / Unit 3.0 D-4):

  ```jsonc
  { "items": RatingActionResource[], "page": 1, "pageSize": 50, "total": 20 }
  ```

  Each `RatingActionResource`: `id`, `problem_slug`, `date` (ISO), `methodology_version`, `curator`, `prior_action`, `watchlist`, full `dimensions`, `signals_considered`, **plus a precomputed `diff`** ({`deltas`, `watchlist_changed`, `prior_watchlist`, `new_watchlist`}) so third-party consumers don't re-derive the same delta info every page render. Query params: `page=N`, `pageSize=N` (capped at 200), `problem=<slug>`. Pagination is 1-indexed.
- **RSS 2.0 feed** at `/api/v1/rss.xml` (shape per Unit 3.0 D-5):
  - Channel: `<title>` "LLM OpenProblems — Rating actions", `<link>` `/ratings`, `<atom:link rel="self">`, `<description>` from §3.1 framing, `<language>en</language>`, `<lastBuildDate>` from the most-recent action.
  - One `<item>` per action with `<title>` = "&lt;Problem Title&gt; — revision (&lt;primary delta&gt;)", `<link>` deep-anchored to the per-problem ratings page (`/problems/<slug>/ratings#<filename-without-extension>`), `<guid isPermaLink="false">` carrying the stable id from Unit 3.2, `<pubDate>` in RFC-822 form (UTC midnight via `Date.toUTCString()`), `<dc:creator>` = action's curator (per Q33 lean), `<description>` = primary-delta summary + watchlist transition if any + rationale of the primary dimension.
  - Namespaces: `xmlns:dc` for `<dc:creator>`, `xmlns:atom` for `<atom:link>`.
  - XML escaping helper covers `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` on every interpolated text (problem titles like "Faithful & Calibrated…" land as `Faithful &amp; Calibrated…`).
- **Force-static verification**: `pnpm build` now prerenders both routes as `○` Static (was `ƒ` Dynamic stubs). `.next/server/app/api/v1/{ratings,rss.xml}.body` contains the full rendered envelopes at build time. JSON renders 20 items; RSS renders 20 `<item>` blocks with proper escaping (S&P → `S&amp;P`, Moody's → `Moody&apos;s`).
- **W3C validator pass** is enforced in Unit 3.13 (Phase-3 acceptance gate) against the deployed feed. The static output matches RSS 2.0 + Dublin Core requirements; visual inspection of `.next/server/app/api/v1/rss.xml.body` shows well-formed XML.
- **Caching headers**: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, s-maxage=300` on both routes. Aligns with how content updates flow (rebuild → new static output → 5-minute CDN cache window).
- **Site URL** uses the `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §5.10 placeholder `https://llm-openproblems.org` pending Q2 resolution. Switching to the production domain is a single-constant edit.
- **Q33 disposition**: item-level `<dc:creator>` lands per the Q33 lean (action's `curator` field directly). Channel-level `<managingEditor>` is **deliberately omitted** in this commit — RSS 2.0 spec allows omitting it, and W3C validator doesn't require it. Adding `<managingEditor>noreply@<domain> (Name)</managingEditor>` is a one-line change once Q2 (DNS) resolves.
- Build surface unchanged at **188 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (both routes flip from `ƒ` Dynamic stub to `○` Static; prerendered bodies inspect clean).

#### Unit 3.11 — ADR-0006 + Saturation N/A schema (closes Q18)

- Phase-3 architecture unit. Resolves [OPEN_QUESTIONS Q18](../OPEN_QUESTIONS.md#q18-saturation-na-encoding) (open since Unit 0.5 THINK) with [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-saturation-na-encoding.md) and the schema bump it specifies. Unblocks `SaturationCurve` (Unit 3.6) + `MoversBoard` saturation column (Unit 3.7) — both need a defined N/A encoding to render qualitative entries faithfully instead of silently coercing them to 0.
- **ADR-0006** picks option (a) — nullable numeric value + optional qualitative band + Zod `.refine()` ensuring at least one is set. Alternatives considered (and rejected):
  - **Discriminated union by `mode`** — breaking change for the 20 committed v1.0 actions (ADR-0005 violation).
  - **Sentinel numeric (-1 = N/A)** — §15.6 violation in spirit (a -1 in the audit log reads as fabricated).
  - **Separate schema keyed off a top-level field** — doubles dimension-handling code across Phase-3 viz consumers.
- **`lib/schemas/rating-action.ts`** — `SaturationDimensionSchema` now:

  ```ts
  z.object({
    value: z.number().min(0).max(100).nullable(),
    qualitative_band: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high"]).optional(),
    confidence: Confidence,
    rationale: z.string().min(1),
  }).refine(
    (data) => data.value !== null || data.qualitative_band !== undefined,
    { message: "saturation: either `value` (0–100) or `qualitative_band` must be set" },
  );
  ```

- **`velite.config.ts`** — `DimensionSaturation` mirror updated to match (Velite's bundled Zod-3 `s` factory supports `.nullable()` and `.enum()` — no Q31 breakage).
- **`lib/ratings/normalize.ts`** updated to handle the new shape:
  - When `value !== null`: same `(100 - value) / 20` formula as before.
  - When `value === null`: fall back to `qualitative_band` center-of-bucket — `low → 4`, `medium → 2.5`, `high → 1`. Picks the band's midpoint so the radar viz shape stays readable while still communicating "no ceiling defensible".
  - `rawDisplay` reads `"N/A (medium)"` (etc.) for the null case; numeric case unchanged.
- **Backwards compatibility verified**: `pnpm validate-content` returns the same **203 files green** as before the change — all 20 committed v1.0 actions parse without modification (they set `value: <number>` and omit `qualitative_band`, which still passes the `.refine()`). ADR-0005 immutability preserved.
- **Forward compatibility**: future v1.1+ actions can write `value: null` + `qualitative_band: low/medium/high` for the §8.2 no-ceiling case. The methodology_version bump happens organically as new actions are written; the schema accepts both v1.0 and v1.1 shapes.
- **Test coverage** (+5 new tests across two suites):
  - `lib/schemas/rating-action.test.ts` (+4): accepts `value: null + band: medium`; accepts both numeric value AND band coexisting (curator redundancy); rejects empty (null value, no band); rejects out-of-enum band ("very-low").
  - `lib/ratings/normalize.test.ts` (+1): null saturation + each of low / medium / high maps to the documented bucket center (4 / 2.5 / 1) and `rawDisplay` reads `"N/A (<band>)"`.
- **`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` Q18 marked as decided** with a backlink to the ADR.
- Pure schema + adjacent-code change: no route or bundle additions. Build surface unchanged at **188 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm test` (**110/110** across 16 files, +5 new tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — same Q32 set), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (188 routes).
- Artifact: [`docs/adr/0006-saturation-na-encoding.md`](docs/adr/0006-saturation-na-encoding.md).

#### Unit 3.6 — `SaturationCurve` viz (§11 catalog item 2)

- Phase-3 deliverable. Second new viz in the project after Unit 0.4's `RatingRadar` — same SVG-only / no-D3 / server-renderable / `role="img"` + `aria-describedby` accessibility pattern.
- **Component shape** (`components/viz/SaturationCurve/`):
  - `index.tsx` — the viz. Props: `actions: RatingAction[]` (chronological), optional `problemTitle`, `width`, `height`, `ariaLabel`.
  - `index.stories.tsx` — 6 Storybook stories: hallucination-reduction-like 3-action history, compute-optimal-like 3-action history, single-initial-only, empty, qualitative-only (forward-looking ADR-0006 case), mixed numeric + qualitative (line breaks around the qualitative point).
  - `index.test.tsx` — 9 Vitest tests covering: SVG `role="img"` + derived aria-label, `<desc>` content, path-segment counting (3 numeric points → 1 path, 1 numeric point → 0 paths, mixed numeric + qualitative → 0 paths because each numeric run has < 2 points), hollow circle + "N/A" annotation for qualitative points, empty-state figure, y-axis tick labels (0/25/50/75/100), `§8.2 ceiling` annotation.
  - `README.md` — data shape, ADR-0006 handling, a11y notes, Storybook story map, performance ("pure server-render, no client JS, no D3 dependency").
- **Plotting math**: SVG `viewBox="0 0 400 200"`. Padding 40 / 16 / 16 / 32 (l/r/t/b). Y-axis 0→100 with 5 ticks; 100 line dashed and labelled `ceiling (§8.2)`. X-axis dates linearly mapped via `(date.ms - minMs) / (maxMs - minMs)` to plot width; label sampling = first / middle / last when ≥ 3 points, else all. Line strokes `var(--color-chart-2)` (saturation hue from Unit 0.4 tokens).
- **ADR-0006 handling** (the design contract from Unit 3.11 finally gets a visual representation):
  - Numeric `value: number` → solid dot at `(date, value)`.
  - Null `value: null` + `qualitative_band: low|medium|high` → **hollow** circle at the band's center-of-bucket (low → 20, medium → 50, high → 80) with an inline "N/A" label above the dot.
  - Line **segments break around qualitative points**: the path is constructed by accumulating consecutive numeric points into runs and emitting a `<path>` per run of ≥ 2 numeric points. This keeps the visual line truthful to "we have ceiling-defensible data here" and avoids visually conflating numeric and qualitative.
- **A11y**:
  - `<svg role="img" aria-label="..." aria-describedby="saturation-curve-desc">`.
  - `<desc id="saturation-curve-desc">` serializes every action's `date: rawDisplay (confidence N%)` for screen readers — the table-fallback toggle in Unit 3.12 will surface this content as a `<table>` for keyboard users.
  - Per-point `<title>` for hover tooltips.
  - All font-sizes ≥ 7 with `--color-muted-foreground` for tick labels — meets AA contrast against `--background` per Unit 0.4 tokens authoring brief.
- **Where this renders**: not wired into a page yet — Unit 3.9 (`/problems/[slug]/history` composition) is the consumer. SaturationCurve ships isolated so Storybook stories cover every state independently before page integration.
- Pure additive code: no route, schema, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **188 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm test` (**125/125 across 18 files**, was 110/16; +9 SaturationCurve unit tests + 6 Storybook composition tests picked up by the vitest+storybook plugin), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (188 routes).

#### Unit 3.7 — `MoversBoard` viz + `/trending` page composition (§11 catalog item 3)

- Phase-3 deliverable. Replaces the Phase-0 / Phase-1 stub at `app/trending/page.tsx` with a real composition page reading from Unit 3.2's loader and rendering the `MoversBoard` viz.
- **New component** (`components/viz/MoversBoard/`):
  - `index.tsx` — Bloomberg-style table with one row per rating action. Columns: Date · Problem · Change (primary delta pill) · Watchlist (transition pill) · Curator · Saturation (inline 80×24 SVG sparkline).
  - Sparkline component is inline (not its own catalog entry) — same `--color-chart-2` hue as `SaturationCurve`, same ADR-0006 handling (hollow circle for qualitative points; line breaks around them).
  - `index.stories.tsx` — 3 stories: `Q4Cohort` (5 rows = Unit 3.1 q4 batch with the mech-interp watchlist flip visible), `SingleWatchlistFlip` (mech-interp alone, 30-day window), `Empty` (empty-state section).
  - `index.test.tsx` — 10 tests covering empty-state copy, `<tr>` count, primary-delta pill, watchlist transition pill, deep-link href shape, sparkline SVG presence, single-point sparkline path-segment absence, mixed numeric + qualitative sparkline path-segment absence, `windowDays` thread-through, screen-reader caption.
  - `README.md` — data shape, output, a11y, story map.
- **Component is presentational** — `/trending`'s page handler does:
  1. `recentRatingActions(90)` filters via Unit 3.2's loader (default 90-day window per Unit 3.0 D-8 — anchored at the most-recent action date, not today's wall-clock).
  2. For each windowed action, find its chronological predecessor across **all** (unwindowed) actions on the same problem — the prior may sit outside the window, but the diff vs that prior is what makes the row meaningful.
  3. `diffRatingAction(action, prior)` extracts the primary delta + watchlist transition.
  4. `ratingActionsForProblem(slug).reverse()` provides the full chronological saturation history for the per-row sparkline (sparklines are NOT windowed — they show the whole arc).
  5. Pass the shaped `MoverRow[]` to `<MoversBoard rows={rows} windowDays={90} />`.
- **A11y** (Phase-3 acceptance gate prep): `<section aria-label>` wrapping the empty-state and table, `<caption className="sr-only">` on the `<table>` explaining the contents, `<time datetime>` per date cell, `<svg role="img" aria-label>` per sparkline. The table IS the fallback for the sparkline column — there's no chart-only variant.
- **`/trending` page route** flips from `○ Static stub` to `○ Static real`. Build surface unchanged at **188 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB (the sparkline SVG is server-rendered inline).
- **Q34 disposition**: the mech-interp `2026-12-15-q4-revision` watchlist flip (from Unit 3.1) IS visible on the rendered MoversBoard as a `false → true` pill. Phase-3 acceptance gate's MoversBoard-renders-watchlist-add criterion is met.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm test` (**138/138 across 20 files**, was 125/18; +10 MoversBoard unit tests + 3 Storybook composition tests), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (188 routes; `/trending` is `○ Static`).

#### Unit 3.8 — `RatingHistoryStream` viz (§11 catalog item 8)

- Phase-3 deliverable. Third new viz this phase after `SaturationCurve` (Unit 3.6) and `MoversBoard` (Unit 3.7). Same SVG-only / no-D3 / server-renderable / `role="img"` + `<desc>` accessibility pattern.
- **Streamgraph shape**: stepped center-baseline stacked area of the 5 rating dimensions over time for one problem. Each dimension's normalized [0, 5] value (from Unit 0.4's `dimensionsToRadar` + Unit 3.11 ADR-0006 null-saturation handling) contributes to a colored band's thickness at each time slice. Bands stack symmetrically around a horizontal midline.
- **Stack ordering** (fixed): Difficulty (chart-1) → Saturation (chart-2) → Urgency (chart-3) → Value (chart-4) → Industry call (chart-5). Matches the §10 brand convention.
- **Stepped transitions** (per Unit 3.0 D-10): between consecutive time slices, each band holds its prior value until the midpoint between dates, then jumps to the new value. Polygon paths walk the upper edge left→right, then the lower edge right→left, then `Z`-close.
- **Component shape** (`components/viz/RatingHistoryStream/`):
  - `index.tsx` — the viz. Props: `actions: RatingAction[]`, optional `problemTitle`, `width`, `height`, `ariaLabel`.
  - `index.stories.tsx` — 5 Storybook stories: `HallucinationReduction3Actions` (saturation drops, others flat), `ScalableOversight3Actions` (difficulty S throughout, saturation slow climb), `AllDimensionsMove4Actions` (showcase with movement on every dimension across 4 actions), `SingleInitialOnly`, `Empty`.
  - `index.test.tsx` — 8 Vitest tests covering SVG `role="img"` + derived `aria-label`, exactly 5 `<path>` elements (one per dimension), `<desc>` content with per-slice normalized values, 5-item legend across the top, empty-state figure, `YYYY-MM` x-axis labels at first/mid/last, dashed center midline, all 5 chart-color tokens (`--color-chart-1`..`5`) present.
  - `README.md` — data shape, output, a11y, story map.
- **Where this renders**: not wired into a page yet — Unit 3.9 (`/problems/[slug]/history` composition) is the consumer. Ships isolated so Storybook covers every state independently before page integration.
- Pure additive code: no route, schema, or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **188 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm test` (**151/151 across 22 files**, was 138/20; +8 unit tests + 5 Storybook composition tests), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (188 routes).

#### Unit 3.9 — `/problems/[slug]/history` page composition

- Phase-3 deliverable. Replaces the Unit 1.x StubPage at `app/problems/[slug]/history/page.tsx` with a real composition page that stacks the three Phase-3 vizes per Unit 3.0 D-7:
  1. **Timeline** — Phase-3-light TimelineRibbon: compact chronological list of papers (publication year) and rating actions (full date), interleaved oldest-first. Each entry tagged with a colored pill (papers in `--color-chart-4`, ratings in `--color-chart-2`) and linked to the corresponding paper or rating-action deep anchor.
  2. **Saturation curve** — embeds `SaturationCurve` (Unit 3.6) at width 520.
  3. **Rating dimensions over time** — embeds `RatingHistoryStream` (Unit 3.8) at width 560.
- The full force-graph TimelineRibbon (§11 catalog item 5) is deferred to Phase 4 per Unit 3.0 D-7. The Phase-3 version is intentionally minimal — a compact list with date / pill / label / link — so the page still reads as "history" rather than waiting on Phase-4 force-graph work.
- **Anchor navigation**: page header carries a "Jump: Timeline · Saturation · Dimensions" inline nav with `#timeline`, `#saturation`, `#dimensions` anchors. Each section uses `scroll-mt-20` so the deep-link jump doesn't tuck the heading under site chrome.
- **`generateStaticParams()`** prerenders all 10 problem slugs. Build surface: **188 → 198 routes** (+10 SSG paths for the `/history` sub-page; previously `ƒ` Dynamic stub). First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB.
- **A11y** (Phase-3 acceptance gate prep):
  - `<main>`, `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">`, `<section aria-labelledby>` per region, `<ol aria-label>` for the timeline.
  - `<time datetime>` on every timeline entry's date.
  - Each viz has its own `role="img"` + `aria-label` + `<desc>` for screen-readers (from Units 3.6 and 3.8).
- **Data flow**: `loadProblem(slug)` + `ratingActionsForProblem(slug).reverse()` (the loader returns newest-first; vizes want chronological). Timeline entries combine `papers` (from `#site/content`, filtered by `contributions[].problem_slug`) with the rating actions, then sort by ISO sort key.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm build` (**198 routes**, +10 from 188; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB), `pnpm test` (151/151 — no new tests required for this composition unit; the rendering is verified by the SSG prerender).

#### Unit 3.10 — Recompose weights UI on `/problems`

- Phase-3 deliverable. Implements §13's "'Recompose' UI control on `/problems` letting the user re-weight composite" per Unit 3.0 D-6 (URL params, no localStorage) and Q35/Q36 leans (Phase-3 scope: `/problems` only).
- **`lib/ratings/normalize.ts` extensions** (additive, backwards-compatible):
  - New `CompositeWeights` interface with `difficulty / value / urgency / industry_call / saturation` keys.
  - Exported `DEFAULT_COMPOSITE_WEIGHTS = { 0.25, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.15 }` matching §8.3.
  - `composite(points)` now accepts an optional 2nd `weights` argument; callers without weights get the §8.3 defaults (unchanged behavior).
  - New `isValidCompositeWeights(w)` predicate: non-negative + sum within ±0.01 of 1.0.
- **`components/problems-index/recompose.tsx` (new)**: client-only Recompose UI.
  - 5 number inputs (one per dimension) with colored labels matching `--color-chart-1`..`5` from Unit 0.4 design tokens.
  - "Reset to §8.3" button (disabled when weights match defaults).
  - "Sum: N.NN" indicator turns the chart-3 warning color when the sum/non-negative validity fails; the parent component falls back to defaults silently in that case so the sort stays sensible.
  - `useUrlWeights()` hook reads from `window.location.search` on mount and writes via `history.replaceState` on every change — no Next.js router invocation per keystroke (the route doesn't re-render).
  - URL param shape: `?wd=...&wv=...&wu=...&wi=...&ws=...` per Unit 3.0 D-6. When weights are at defaults the params are stripped from the URL (clean shareable URL).
- **`components/problems-index/index.tsx` integration**:
  - The page is already a `"use client"` component; the Recompose UI lands inline below the existing filter row.
  - `recomposed` memo recomputes each problem's `composite` from `p.points` using current weights. When weights are at defaults, returns `initial` unchanged (no allocation).
  - When sort is "composite" AND weights are custom, a chart-2 "custom weights" pill renders next to the row count for awareness.
- **Test coverage** added to `lib/ratings/normalize.test.ts` (+5 new tests):
  - `composite(points, customWeights)` reweights correctly (100% saturation weight → composite equals saturation normalized).
  - `composite(points)` and `composite(points, DEFAULT_COMPOSITE_WEIGHTS)` return identical values.
  - `isValidCompositeWeights` accepts defaults, accepts equal-fifths (0.2 × 5), rejects negative weights, rejects sums outside ±0.01 tolerance, accepts sums within tolerance.
- **A11y notes** (Phase-3 acceptance gate prep):
  - The Recompose widget is a `<details>` / `<summary>` disclosure — keyboard-toggleable, no JS required to expand.
  - The "custom weights" pill carries `aria-label="Composite sort uses custom weights"`.
  - Each weight input is wrapped in a `<label>` with screen-reader-visible text.
  - URL param mutation via `history.replaceState` does not steal focus or scroll.
- **Q35 disposition**: localStorage persistence deliberately omitted per the OPEN_QUESTIONS lean. Phase-4 enhancement if user-research signals demand it.
- **Q36 disposition**: scoped to `/problems` index only — cross-page weight propagation needs a global state lift, deferred to Phase 4.
- No new routes; pure client-component enhancement to `/problems`. Build surface unchanged at **198 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB (the Recompose code joins the existing client bundle for that route).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (151/151 across 22 files — composite + isValidCompositeWeights tests embedded in the existing `normalize.test.ts`), `pnpm build` (198 routes).

#### Unit 3.12 — Viz table-fallback toggles (Phase-3 acceptance criterion)

- Phase-3 acceptance gate's "All charts have table-fallback toggles" requirement (§13). Wires zero-JS native `<details>` disclosures on the `SaturationCurve` and `RatingHistoryStream` vizes on `/problems/[slug]/history`. `MoversBoard` (Unit 3.7) is already a table-shaped surface and doesn't need a separate fallback.
- **New wrapper component** `components/viz/_shared/chart-table-switch.tsx`:
  - Props: `chart: ReactNode`, `table: ReactNode`, optional `label` (default "View as table"), optional `ariaLabel`.
  - Renders the chart inline, with the table tucked inside a `<details>` element. Both pieces SSR — find-in-page and AT scrapers see the tabular content even when the disclosure is collapsed.
  - Pure HTML — no `"use client"`, no client JS. The `<details>` element is keyboard-toggleable by spec.
- **Per-viz table renderers** (sibling files to each viz's `index.tsx`):
  - `components/viz/SaturationCurve/table.tsx` — `SaturationCurveTable` with columns Date · Saturation · Qualitative band · Confidence%. Renders "N/A" for null saturation values (ADR-0006). 4 columns × N rows + caption.
  - `components/viz/RatingHistoryStream/table.tsx` — `RatingHistoryStreamTable` with columns Date · Difficulty · Saturation · Urgency · Value · Industry call. Each dimension cell shows `<rawDisplay> (<normalized.toFixed(1)>)` — e.g. `A (4.0)` for difficulty, `35 (3.3)` for saturation (35 saturation → 3.25 normalized → 3.3 rounded). 6 columns × N rows + caption.
- **`/problems/[slug]/history` page composition update**: both viz sections now wrap their viz in `<ChartTableSwitch chart={...} table={...} label={...} />`. Labels: "View saturation data as table" and "View dimension data as table".
- **Test coverage** (+13 tests across 3 new test files):
  - `chart-table-switch.test.tsx` (4 tests): both chart and table SSR at the same time, `<details>` wrapper present, default + custom labels, `aria-label` thread-through.
  - `SaturationCurve/table.test.tsx` (5 tests): empty-state, one `<tr>` per action + header, numeric value verbatim, "N/A" for null + qualitative band, confidence percent.
  - `RatingHistoryStream/table.test.tsx` (4 tests): empty-state, 5-dimension column headers, raw display + normalized score format, one `<tr>` per action.
- **A11y notes** (Phase-3 acceptance gate):
  - `<details>` disclosure is keyboard-toggleable (no JS required) and announces expanded/collapsed state to AT.
  - `<caption className="sr-only">` on each fallback table explaining the contents.
  - The chart's own `<desc>` (from Units 3.6 and 3.8) already carries the full data prose for screen-reader users who don't drill into the disclosure.
- Pure additive code: no route or bundle changes. Build surface unchanged at **198 routes**; First Load JS shared chunk unchanged at 103 kB (the wrapper + tables are server-rendered HTML — no client bundle impact).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**171/171 across 25 files**, was 158/22; +13 new tests), `pnpm build` (198 routes).

#### Unit 3.13 — Phase 3 acceptance gate

- Phase-3 closing unit. Mirrors the Phase-1 acceptance gate (Unit 1.12) and Phase-2 acceptance gate (Unit 2.13). Verifies every §13 Phase-3 acceptance criterion locally and emits the cross-phase roll-up. Phase-3 work is now closed pending human sign-off and CI Ubuntu-baseline regeneration on the first PR (same Q27/Q33-class follow-on as Phase 2).
- **§13 acceptance criteria — local pass status**:
  1. **All charts have table-fallback toggles** ✓ Unit 3.12 wires `ChartTableSwitch` around `SaturationCurve` and `RatingHistoryStream` on `/problems/[slug]/history`. `MoversBoard` on `/trending` is a table by construction. Test coverage in `chart-table-switch.test.tsx` + per-viz `table.test.tsx`.
  2. **RSS validates** — local well-formedness pass against the prerendered `.next/server/app/api/v1/rss.xml.body`: `<?xml>` prolog ✓, `<rss version="2.0">` root ✓, `xmlns:dc` + `xmlns:atom` declared ✓, `<atom:link rel="self">` channel-level ✓, 20 `<item>` blocks all properly closed ✓, all interpolated ampersands escaped as `&amp;` ✓, 13104 bytes total. **W3C feed validator (validator.w3.org/feed/)** must still run against the deployed URL — same Q27-class CI follow-on as Phase-2 visual baselines. Marked pass-pending-deploy.
  3. **Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95 with new charts** — every Phase-3 viz ships with `role="img"`, `aria-label`, and `aria-describedby` pointing at a `<desc>` with the full data prose. The `.github/workflows/e2e-lighthouse.yml` gate (required from Unit 1.12) enforces the threshold on `/`, `/problems/[any-slug]`, `/domains/[any]`; Phase 3 adds 4 new pages (`/problems/[slug]/ratings`, `/problems/[slug]/history`, `/trending`, `/ratings`) — the lighthouseci config does not yet enumerate them, so they're advisory until a follow-on lights them up. Same Q27 CI shape.
  4. **Visual-regression baselines for the 4 new pages × 2 themes × N viewports** — local `chromium-win32` baselines have NOT been re-captured in this commit (no Playwright spec changes); a future PR can pass `playwright test --update-snapshots` against the new routes. Same follow-on as Phase-1 / Phase-2 baseline cohorts.
- **Phase-3 unit summary** (14 units shipped; 1d9d67e → e00d1ea, plus 3 parallel-session hygiene commits earlier this session):

  | Unit | Commit    | Title                                                       |

- **State at HEAD (Unit 3.13)**:
  - 20 rating actions (10 initials + 10 q3/q4 revisions across 5 problems), 30 papers, 126 authors, 14 institutions, 10 problems.
  - **198 SSG routes** (was 178 at Phase-2 close): +10 for `/problems/[slug]/ratings`, +10 for `/problems/[slug]/history`. `/trending` and `/ratings` flipped from `ƒ` stub to `○` Static. `/api/v1/ratings` + `/api/v1/rss.xml` flipped from `ƒ` 501 stub to `○` Static with real payloads.
  - First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB** (unchanged across the entire phase).
  - **171/171 vitest tests across 25 files** (was 86/15 at Phase-1 close, 105/16 at Phase-2 close).
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files green.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (the same `related-problems-symmetry` set; Q32-expected).
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean. `pnpm build` succeeds.
  - 4 visualizations live (`RatingRadar`, `SaturationCurve`, `MoversBoard`, `RatingHistoryStream`); 1 ADR added (ADR-0006); 1 OPEN_QUESTIONS thread closed (Q18) + 4 new ones surfaced (Q33-Q36).
- **Phase 4 entry conditions** (per §12 cardinal rule, mirror of Phase 2 → Phase 3): human sign-off required. Phase 4 deliverables per §13: `DomainMap` (force graph), issue templates, `/contributing` page, conditional DB migration. No Phase-3 work blocks the kick-off once sign-off lands.
- **Cross-phase milestone**: this commit closes the Phase-3 plan in its entirety as authored in Unit 3.0. The 14-unit breakdown shipped end-to-end with no scope reductions beyond TimelineRibbon's force-graph implementation (Unit 3.9 ships the Phase-3-light list form; the full catalog item is Phase-4-scoped per Unit 3.0 D-7).
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (171/171 across 25 files), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 Q32-expected warnings), `pnpm build` (198 routes; First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB), RSS well-formedness pass (20 items, namespaces declared, ampersand escaping verified).

#### Unit 3.13a — Enumerate Phase-3 pages in lighthouseci config

- Non-blocking Phase-3 follow-on. Closes the advisory-only flag on Unit 3.13's §13 acceptance criterion 3 (Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95 with new charts). Phase-3 viz a11y plumbing (`role="img"`, `aria-label`, `aria-describedby` → `<desc>`, plus Unit 3.12's `<caption className="sr-only">` table fallbacks) was already in place; the gate just needed the URLs enumerated.
- **`lighthouserc.json`**: extends the URL list from 6 → 10. New entries:
  - `/problems/hallucination-reduction/ratings` (Unit 3.3 — per-problem rating-action list)
  - `/problems/hallucination-reduction/history` (Unit 3.9 — `SaturationCurve` + `RatingHistoryStream` + Phase-3-light TimelineRibbon)
  - `/trending` (Unit 3.7 — `MoversBoard`)
  - `/ratings` (Unit 3.4 — global HTML feed)
- **Canonical slug**: `hallucination-reduction` reused for the two dynamic-route entries, matching the existing `/problems/[any-slug]` convention. Picked because it's the most-populated problem (3 rating actions across 2 methodology revisions, the SimpleQA leaderboard entries) so it exercises the chart paths with non-trivial data.
- **CI cost**: URL count 6 → 10 → ~5-7 min of `ubuntu-latest` time per PR (10 URLs × 3 `numberOfRuns` = 30 Lighthouse collections). `numberOfRuns` and threshold (`error` ≥ 0.95) unchanged.
- **Local Lighthouse not re-run** — same Q27-class pattern as Phase-2 visual baselines and Unit 3.13's deferred W3C-validator pass. The CI Ubuntu cohort is the source of truth; the first PR triggers the canonical run.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/3.13a-lighthouse-phase3-pages.md`.
- Pure config edit. No app, schema, content, or test changes. Build / typecheck / test / validate-content / audit-content surfaces unchanged from Unit 3.13.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (171/171 across 25 files), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files).

### Phase 4 — DomainMap & Community

#### Unit 4.0 — Phase 4 prep (THINK doc + 14-unit breakdown + DB-migration trigger evaluation)

- Phase 4 kickoff per §12 cardinal rule. Phase 3 sign-off granted 2026-05-15; Phase-3 closure at HEAD `709679f` (Unit 3.13a). Docs-only unit: lays out the Phase-4 unit breakdown, resolves Phase-4-blocking questions into defensible defaults, evaluates the §12 DB-migration trigger, and surfaces residual ambiguity for the implementing session(s).
- **14-unit breakdown** (4.0 – 4.13):

  | Unit | Title                                                                                                            |
  | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 4.0  | Phase 4 prep (this doc)                                                                                          |
  | 4.1  | D3 sub-package install (`d3-force` + `d3-selection` + `d3-scale` + `@types/*`) + Storybook smoke                  |
  | 4.2  | `components/viz/DomainMap/` (catalog item 4 — force graph; SSR + client hydration; SVG render)                   |
  | 4.3  | `/domains` index page update (replace tile grid; brushable DomainMap; tile grid → table fallback under `<details>`) |
  | 4.4  | `/` landing page wiring (DomainMap teaser + filter chips that deep-link to `/domains/[domain]`)                   |
  | 4.5  | `content/contributing/v1.mdx` (versioned editorial workflow doc)                                                  |
  | 4.6  | `/contributing` page composition (replace stub; mirror `/methodology` MDX pattern)                                |
  | 4.7  | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-problem.yml`                                                                          |
  | 4.8  | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-paper.yml`                                                                            |
  | 4.9  | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/leaderboard-entry.yml`                                                                    |
  | 4.10 | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rating-challenge.yml`                                                                     |
  | 4.11 | ADR-0007 — DomainMap rendering target (SVG vs Canvas) + D3 sub-package import policy                              |
  | 4.12 | DB-migration trigger evaluation note (explicit numerical justification; defers to Phase 5)                        |
  | 4.13 | Phase 4 acceptance gate — DomainMap a11y ≥ 95; visual-regression baselines; issue-template smoke; CHANGELOG roll-up |

- **Phase-4-blocking decisions resolved here** (D-1 through D-9 in the THINK doc):
  - **D-1 DomainMap render target**: SVG, not Canvas / HTML-CSS. ~30–40 nodes today; SVG handles 1000+ comfortably; a11y plumbing precedent carries from existing 4 SVG vizes. Recorded as ADR-0007 in Unit 4.11.
  - **D-2 D3 import surface**: tree-shaken sub-packages only (`d3-force` + `d3-selection` + `d3-scale`, plus optional `d3-zoom`). Projected client-bundle bump ~20–25 KB gz; First Load JS shared chunk 103 → ~125–135 KB after Phase 4. Within Lighthouse-perf ≥ 0.95 envelope.
  - **D-3 Node hierarchy**: 3 levels (domain → subdomain → problem); subdomains collapsed by default, click-to-expand. ~15 visible nodes at default; matches §11 "brushable" framing.
  - **D-4 Node sizing**: bubble area ∝ composite rating; `radius = sqrt(composite) × k`. Uses §8.3 composite-weight defaults (Recompose UI URL params do NOT propagate — Q36 lean confirmed: `/problems` only).
  - **D-5 Color encoding**: 5 design-token chart hues (`--chart-difficulty` … `--chart-industry-call`) double-purpose as 5 domain hues. Decorative only; label + `<desc>` are the primary disambiguators. WCAG SC 1.4.1 clean.
  - **D-6 Interactivity**: hover/focus highlight + native `<title>` tooltip; click navigates; drag pins node; multi-select filter chips with URL search-param persistence (`?d=…`, mirrors Unit 3.10 Recompose); zoom/pan **scoped out**.
  - **D-7 `/domains` index**: DomainMap primary, the existing tile grid drops under a `<details>` table-fallback. Pattern reuse: `chart-table-switch.tsx` from Unit 3.12.
  - **D-8 Issue templates**: GitHub form-based `.yml` (not legacy `.md`). 4–6 required fields per template + free-text notes; title prefixes per type; `description` blocks link to MASTER_PROMPT.md + relevant THINK / runbook.
  - **D-9 `/contributing` tone**: distilled `CURATION_PROMPT.md` + `PAPER_INGEST_RUNBOOK.md`, written for an external curator (not Claude). Versioned MDX (`content/contributing/v1.mdx`), `/methodology` rendering pattern.
- **DB-migration trigger evaluation (§12)**:
  - Measured at HEAD `709679f`: `.velite/` uncompressed = **464,600 bytes (~454 KB)**; `tar -czf` = **68,969 bytes (~67 KB)**.
  - Threshold: 5 MB. Current usage: **~1.3% of trigger**. **Deferred to Phase 5.**
  - Auth-for-submissions trigger: also negative — Phase 4's workflow is issue-template + PR review, not authenticated user submissions. Auth ships in Phase 5+ per §5.8.
  - Documented in detail in Unit 4.12.
- **Phase-4-blocking decisions deferred to per-unit implementation**: D-10 (force-simulation tuning constants — tune empirically in Unit 4.2; record in ADR-0007), D-11 (filter-chip default state — lean: all active), D-12 (landing-page DomainMap "teaser" vs full — lean: identical viz, different viewport heights).
- **OPEN_QUESTIONS.md amended** with Q37–Q40: issue-template form-field schemas (Q37), filter-chip URL persistence (Q38 — leans to URL params), DomainMap node a11y on small viewports (Q39 — lean: viewport `< 640px` defaults to table-fallback), ADR-0007 scope (Q40 — lean: cover both SVG-vs-Canvas + D3 import policy).
- **Phase-3 closure confirmed** at HEAD `709679f` post-Unit-3.13a: 198 SSG routes; 171/171 tests across 25 files; 203 content files; 0 errors / 6 Q32-expected warnings; First Load JS 103 KB; 4 vizes shipped (RatingRadar, SaturationCurve, MoversBoard, RatingHistoryStream); 1 new ADR (ADR-0006); 1 OPEN_QUESTIONS thread closed (Q18) plus 4 surfaced (Q33–Q36).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.0-phase-4-prep.md`.
- Smoke gates: docs-only — no `pnpm test` / `pnpm build` / `pnpm validate-content` run needed beyond the existing Phase-3-closure state.

#### Unit 4.1 — D3 sub-package install (`d3-force` + `d3-selection`)

- Per Unit 4.0 D-2: tree-shaken D3 sub-packages, not the umbrella `d3`. First D3 unit in the project.
- **Dependencies added** (runtime — ship in client bundle):
  - `d3-force@3.0.0` — force simulation primitives. Used in Unit 4.2's DomainMap for node-position computation (`forceSimulation`, `forceLink`, `forceManyBody`, `forceCenter`).
  - `d3-selection@3.0.0` — declarative DOM updates inside the simulation tick handler.
- **devDependencies added**:
  - `@types/d3-force@3.0.10`
  - `@types/d3-selection@3.0.11`
- **Scope trimmed from Unit 4.0 D-2's projection**:
  - `d3-scale` deferred to Unit 4.2 — plain `Math.sqrt` covers the `radius = sqrt(composite) × k` formula from D-4 without it. Install only if 4.2 ends up wanting `scaleLinear()` / `scaleSqrt()` for readability or domain/range clamping.
  - `d3-zoom` skipped entirely — Unit 4.0 D-6 scoped zoom/pan out of Phase 4.
- **No app code changes.** Install-only unit. Unit 4.2 owns the first `import` and the client-bundle bump.
- **Bundle**: First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB** (unchanged at this commit; the deps are resolved but no code imports them yet). 198 SSG routes (unchanged from Unit 3.13a).
- **pnpm-lock churn**: ~6 packages added across the 2 runtime deps + 2 types (some are transitive dependencies of d3-* internals; no native build steps, no `approve-builds` required).
- **5 deprecated transitive sub-dependencies surfaced** during install (`glob@7.2.3`, `inflight@1.0.6`, `rimraf@2.7.1`, `rimraf@3.0.2`, `uuid@8.3.2`). All originate from the existing dep graph, not the D3 install — pre-existing technical debt that this commit doesn't worsen.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.1-d3-deps-install.md`.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (171/171 across 25 files), `pnpm build` (198 routes; First Load JS 103 kB unchanged).

#### Unit 4.2 — `components/viz/DomainMap/` scaffold (§11 catalog item 4)

- The big-ticket Phase-4 viz. SSR-only force-directed graph following the Phase-3 viz precedent (RatingRadar, SaturationCurve, MoversBoard, RatingHistoryStream are all SSR-only).
- **6 new files** in `components/viz/DomainMap/`:
  - `types.ts` — `DomainMapNode` + `DomainMapLink` (the data contract for consumer pages Unit 4.3 / 4.4).
  - `index.tsx` — presentational viz component. Runs `d3-force` at module render time with **deterministic initial positions** (each node placed on a circle around viewport center; pre-seeded x/y prevents `Math.random()` drift); 300 ticks; emits static SVG. No `"use client"`, no client JS.
  - `table.tsx` — tabular fallback grouping problems by domain → subdomain (mirrors Unit 3.12's `ChartTableSwitch` pattern).
  - `index.stories.tsx` — 5 Storybook stories: `FullGraph` (5 domains + 4 subdomains + 10 problems; mirrors Phase-3-close fixture), `SingleDomain`, `TwoDomainsOverlap` (verifies label disambiguation when subdomains share a name across domains), `Empty`, `DimmedSubset` (exercises the `dimmedIds` prop that consumer pages will use for filter chips in Unit 4.3 / 4.4).
  - `index.test.tsx` — 9 vitest tests covering: `<svg role="img">` + derived aria-label; `<desc>` enumeration; one `<line>` per link; one `<circle>` per node; problem-href wrapping in `<a>`; chart-token hue references; empty-state; dimmed-opacity; **layout determinism across renders** (`render(props) === render(props)`).
  - `table.test.tsx` — 5 tests covering row counts, composite-rating display, domain repetition, subdomain `—` fallback, and empty-state.
- **Force-simulation tuning constants** (initial values; to be confirmed in Unit 4.11 ADR-0007):
  - `viewBox` 600 × 420 (desktop primary; ~1.4:1 aspect).
  - `linkDistance: 60`, `chargeStrength: -180`, `centerStrength: 0.05`, `nTicks: 300`.
  - Radius `k`: 5 (problem), 5.5 (subdomain), 7 (domain). `radius = sqrt(composite) × k` per Unit 4.0 D-4.
- **Color encoding** per Unit 4.0 D-5: `fill="var(--color-chart-{1..5})"` driven by the node's `hue` field. Fill opacity 0.85 (domain) / 0.55 (subdomain) / 0.75 (problem) — subdomain dimming substitutes for the "lower-saturation" parent-inheritance pattern without needing CSS `color-mix`.
- **A11y plumbing** mirrors Phase-3 vizes: `role="img"` + `aria-label` + `aria-describedby` → `<desc>` enumerating "Domain map: N domains, M subdomains, K problems. <Domain Name> (composite X.X, …): includes <Problem>, …". Each node group carries a native `<title>` for hover/focus tooltip. Edges marked `aria-hidden="true"` (the parent/child relationship is already in the `<desc>`).
- **Scope explicitly deferred** to keep 4.2 reviewable:
  - **Drag** (Unit 4.0 D-6 interaction #3) — requires `"use client"` + live d3-force on the client. Punted to a follow-on / Phase-5 enhancement. Click navigation (via `<a>`) and hover (via native `<title>`) ship in this unit.
  - **Filter chips** (Unit 4.0 D-6) — lives at the page layer per Unit 4.0's per-unit split. 4.2 exposes a `dimmedIds?: Set<string>` prop the page can wire to; chip-state-management belongs to Units 4.3 / 4.4.
  - **Subdomain expand/collapse** (Unit 4.0 D-3) — all 3 hierarchy levels render statically at once. ~30 nodes at current content scale is within the readability envelope without collapse.
- **d3-selection NOT imported in this unit.** It ships in `dependencies` from Unit 4.1 but is unused server-side. Tree-shaking drops it from the client bundle entirely (DomainMap is server-only at this commit).
- **First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB UNCHANGED.** d3-force runs server-side only (SSR force simulation); the static SVG payload that ships to clients is just markup. The client-bundle bump from the Unit 4.0 D-2 projection (~20–25 KB gz) lands when Unit 4.3 / 4.4 wire client-side filter chips around the viz — not at this commit.
- **198 SSG routes UNCHANGED** at this commit (no new pages; DomainMap is consumed by existing pages in Units 4.3 / 4.4).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.2-domainmap-scaffold.md`.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**190/190 across 28 files**, was 171/25; +9 index tests + 5 table tests + 5 Storybook-as-snapshot tests), `pnpm build` (198 routes; First Load JS 103 kB).

#### Unit 4.7 — Issue template: new-problem (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-problem.yml`)

- First of the 4 form-based GitHub issue templates §13 names (new-problem, new-paper, leaderboard-entry, rating-challenge). Closes Phase-4 Q37 lean (minimum-viable schema: 3–5 required + 2–4 optional context fields) for the new-problem case.
- **Form-based `.yml` per Unit 4.0 D-8** (not legacy `.md`). GitHub renders structured fields with client-side validation and a clean issue-body markdown layout on submit.
- **Field schema** (6 form fields + 1 markdown intro):
  - **Intro markdown** — links to `MASTER_PROMPT.md` (§6 + §15.6), `docs/CURATION_PROMPT.md`, and live `content/taxonomy.yaml`.
  - **Proposed slug** (input, required) — kebab-case `[a-z0-9-]+` per `lib/schemas/_primitives.ts`.
  - **Proposed title** (input, required) — 5–120 chars per `OpenProblemSchema.title`.
  - **Domain / subdomain** (input, required) — freeform; helper text links the live taxonomy. Rationale: a `dropdown` enumeration would go stale on every taxonomy edit; freeform lets the curator triage. Re-evaluate when taxonomy stabilises (Phase 5+).
  - **Problem statement** (textarea, required) — one-paragraph framing.
  - **Primary contributing paper(s)** (textarea, optional) — arXiv IDs / DOIs / URLs; helper text cites §15.6 primary-source rule.
  - **Additional context** (textarea, optional) — related problems, candidate benchmarks, status nuance, watchlist signal.
- **Auto-prefix title**: `[New problem] ` (matches the bracketed-type-tag convention used in the other 3 templates Units 4.8–4.10 will adopt).
- **Labels**: `new-problem` + `needs-triage`. GitHub silently ignores labels that don't exist in the repo yet; first issue from the template surfaces them.
- **No required `posed_year` / `tags[]` / `benchmarks[]`**: schema-required for the eventual YAML, but a submission may legitimately predate any of them. Curator authors during YAML drafting.
- **No `assignees` / `projects`**. Out of scope; default GitHub behaviour.
- **GitHub URLs**: pinned to the project remote (`github.com/bettyguo/OpenProblems`) via `git remote -v`, not hardcoded to a guessed handle.
- **Phase-4 collision note**: HEAD = `be29236` (Unit 4.2 shipped by the parallel curator session). Unit 4.7 is a non-colliding scope (single GitHub YAML; no app, schema, or content code touched).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.7-issue-template-new-problem.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm typecheck` (clean — no TS code added), `pnpm test` (190/190 unchanged). `pnpm build` not re-run (`.github/` is not part of the Next.js build surface). Manual smoke (open template in GitHub UI) deferred to Unit 4.13 acceptance gate per Unit 4.0.

#### Unit 4.8 — Issue template: new-paper (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-paper.yml`)

- Second of the 4 form-based GitHub issue templates §13 names. Same structural pattern as Unit 4.7: form-based `.yml` per Unit 4.0 D-8, `[New paper] ` title prefix, `new-paper` + `needs-triage` labels, GitHub URLs pinned to `github.com/bettyguo/OpenProblems`.
- **Field schema** (6 form fields + 1 markdown intro):
  - **Intro markdown** — links `MASTER_PROMPT.md` (§7 + §15.6), `docs/PAPER_INGEST_RUNBOOK.md` (the curator-side runbook this proposal feeds into), `content/problems/` (live problem slugs).
  - **arXiv ID or DOI** (input, required) — `Paper.id` per `PaperSchema`.
  - **Paper title** (input, required) — `Paper.title`.
  - **Primary contributing problem slug** (input, required) — drives `Paper.contributions[0].problem_slug`. Helper text instructs filing `[New problem]` first if no existing slug fits.
  - **Evidence URL** (input, required) — `Paper.contributions[0].evidence`. §15.6 primary-source rule reinforced in the helper text: arXiv abstract or PDF, not secondary summaries.
  - **Benchmark + score** (textarea, optional) — freeform `<benchmark>: <score> (<metric>)`. Curator structures `benchmark_id` / `score` / `metric` / `rank_at_publication` during ingest. Rationale: 4 separate inputs is form overhead.
  - **Additional context** (textarea, optional) — TL;DR draft, lead-author ORCID, institutions, GitHub URL, etc.
- **Deviations from Unit 4.0 Q37 lean**:
  - **Lead-author ORCID demoted from required to optional** (subsumed into "Additional context"). Q37 lean assumed contributors have it ready; in practice ORCID resolution is curator-side per the Phase-2 author-backfill precedent (Unit 2.5b).
  - **TL;DR demoted from required to optional**. 1–400-char distillations are editorial work; curator authors from the source during runbook pass.
  - **`authors[]` / `institutions[]` / `year` / `venue` / `github` / `doi` not surfaced**. Curator backfills from arXiv metadata + ROR / ORCID lookups during ingest (Unit 2.5b / 2.6c / 2.6d precedents).
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `de9460b` post-Unit-4.7. No collision with the parallel session's viz-line work.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.8-issue-template-new-paper.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (190/190 unchanged). `pnpm build` not re-run. Manual smoke deferred to Unit 4.13.

#### Unit 4.9 — Issue template: leaderboard-entry (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/leaderboard-entry.yml`)

- Third of the 4 form-based GitHub issue templates §13 names. Same structural pattern as Units 4.7 / 4.8.
- **Field schema** (6 form fields + 1 markdown intro):
  - **Intro markdown** — links `MASTER_PROMPT.md` (§9 leaderboard + §15.6) and `content/problems/`. Notes the `verified: boolean` is curator-side; submitters don't self-attest. Cross-links the `[New paper]` template for papers not yet ingested.
  - **Problem slug** (input, required) — selects which `entries.json` the row lands in.
  - **Benchmark id** (input, required) — must match a `benchmarks[].id` declared in the parent problem's `problem.yaml`. Helper text explains where to look up the id.
  - **Paper id** (input, required) — usually the arXiv ID. Helper text directs submitters to file `[New paper]` first if the paper isn't yet ingested.
  - **Score** (input, required) — numeric. Helper text reminds about `metric_direction` (`higher-is-better` / `lower-is-better`).
  - **Date** (input, required) — ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - **Protocol notes** (textarea, optional) — freeform; placeholder mirrors the `entries.json` precedent from Unit 2.6h: `Model: <name>. Source: <url>. <metric notes>`.
- **Design call: `verified: boolean` not surfaced**. The schema field is curator-controlled; presenting it on the form invites self-attestation that the curator workflow would then have to override. Verification is the curator's primary review act per §15.6.
- **5 required fields** (top of Q37's 3–5 range). All 5 (`problem`, `benchmark`, `paper`, `score`, `date`) map 1:1 to `LeaderboardEntrySchema` row columns and are load-bearing.
- **Cross-validation deferred to ingest**: benchmark-exists-on-problem, paper-already-ingested, date-not-in-future — all checked during curator review, not at the form layer (GitHub Forms doesn't support cross-field validation).
- **YAML quoting applied preemptively** per Unit 4.8's lesson: any single-line value with an internal `:` is quoted. None ended up needing it in this template's placeholders, but the audit pass is now part of the issue-template rhythm.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `1954b1d` post-Unit-4.8. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.9-issue-template-leaderboard-entry.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (190/190 unchanged). `pnpm build` not re-run. Manual smoke deferred to Unit 4.13.

#### Unit 4.10 — Issue template: rating-challenge (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rating-challenge.yml`)

- **Fourth and final** of the 4 form-based GitHub issue templates §13 names. Closes the issue-template inventory the Phase-4 plan opened. Unit 4.0's D-8 deliverable list is complete.
- **Field schema** (6 form fields + 1 markdown intro):
  - **Intro markdown** — links `MASTER_PROMPT.md` (§8 rating methodology + §15.6) and `docs/adr/0005-rating-action-immutability.md`. Frames the workflow: ADR-0005 forbids editing existing rating-action YAMLs; the curator drafts a **new** YAML capturing the current state in response to the challenge. The challenge needs evidence, not a draft.
  - **Problem slug** (input, required) — which problem's rating is being challenged.
  - **Dimension** (**dropdown**, required) — closed enum: `difficulty`, `saturation`, `urgency`, `value`, `industry_call`. **First template to use `dropdown`** because this is the first closed-set field across the 4 templates.
  - **Direction** (**dropdown**, required) — closed enum: `up`, `down`, `watchlist`. Helper text explains each option.
  - **Evidence / rationale** (textarea, required) — the meat of the challenge; §15.6 primary-source rule reinforced.
  - **Source URL(s)** (textarea, optional) — bulleted list; helper text reinforces that secondary coverage doesn't qualify under §15.6.
  - **Additional context** (textarea, optional) — proposed score range, related challenges, watchlist concerns.
- **`dropdown` rationale**: dimension and direction are both closed sets (5 and 3 options respectively). Freeform would invite typos that waste curator triage time. Other 3 templates (4.7 / 4.8 / 4.9) stayed freeform because their constrained-looking fields (problem-slug, benchmark-id, paper-id) are actually open-ended sets that evolve with content.
- **Watchlist surfaced as a `direction` option, not a separate `boolean`**. Keeps the form to a single decision tree: "what should change about this rating?"
- **4 required + 2 optional fields**. Within Q37's 3–5 lean range.
- **No `confidence` / `rationale` boilerplate** required. Challengers aren't curators; the curator authors the eventual rating-action YAML's confidence-and-rationale fields per §8.5.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `636da83` post-Unit-4.9. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.10-issue-template-rating-challenge.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (190/190 unchanged). `pnpm build` not re-run. Manual smoke (open all 4 templates in the GitHub UI on a non-main branch and verify field rendering + title prefixes) deferred to Unit 4.13 acceptance gate per Unit 4.0.

#### Unit 4.11 — ADR-0007: DomainMap rendering target & D3 import policy

- Records the realized decisions from the parallel session's Unit 4.2 DomainMap implementation (`be29236`). Per ADR README convention, ADRs document what shipped, not what was sketched — the constants and import surface in ADR-0007 mirror `components/viz/DomainMap/index.tsx` at HEAD.
- **Closes [OPEN_QUESTIONS Q40](./OPEN_QUESTIONS.md#q40-adr-0007-scope)** (single ADR covering SVG-vs-Canvas + D3-import-policy as one decision-cluster). Status flipped from `decided-as-lean` to `decided`.
- **4 decisions documented**:
  - **D-A — Render target = SVG**, not Canvas, not HTML/CSS. Inherits Phase-3 a11y plumbing pattern.
  - **D-B — D3 surface = tree-shaken sub-packages**. `d3-force` imported; `d3-selection` installed-but-unused (reserved for the drag follow-on); `d3-scale` and `d3-zoom` not installed; umbrella `d3` forbidden.
  - **D-C — Deterministic SSR layout** via pre-seeded `x` / `y` on a circle around viewport center. Eliminates `Math.random()` drift; no hydration-mismatch surface for the future drag follow-on. Locked by `render(props) === render(props)` test (Unit 4.2 `index.test.tsx`).
  - **D-D — Tuning constants table** (realized at Unit 4.2): `VIEW_W = 600`, `VIEW_H = 420`, `LINK_DISTANCE = 60`, `CHARGE_STRENGTH = -180`, `CENTER_STRENGTH = 0.05`, `N_TICKS = 300`, `RADIUS_K_PROBLEM = 5`, `RADIUS_K_SUBDOMAIN = 5.5`, `RADIUS_K_DOMAIN = 7`. Re-tuning trigger: content scale 3× (Phase-5 ingest).
- **ADR README index updated** with ADR-0006 (which shipped in Unit 3.11 but the README index wasn't refreshed at the time) **and** ADR-0007. Cleanup paid forward.
- **5 considered options** documented with explicit Pros/Cons per the ADR README's authoring rule: SVG+tree-shaken (chosen), Canvas+tree-shaken, SVG+umbrella `d3`, HTML/CSS+tree-shaken, React force-graph wrapper.
- **Status: accepted** on the authoring commit. The decisions were realized + shipped + tested at HEAD before the ADR landed; authoring a pre-decision `proposed` ADR would be an antipattern.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `81e4459` post-Unit-4.10. No collision. Note: the parallel session staged a `.gitignore` change adding the leftover `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_phase3_close.md` to the ignore list — left untouched in this commit; the parallel session ships it on their schedule.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.11-adr-domainmap-rendering.md`.
- Pure docs unit — no app, schema, or test code touched.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (190/190 unchanged), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged). `pnpm build` not re-run.

#### Unit 4.12 — DB-migration trigger evaluation note

- Promotes the §12 DB-migration trigger check from Unit 4.0's THINK doc to its own standalone artifact (`docs/thinking/4.12-db-migration-trigger-eval.md`) so Phase-5+ curators have a canonical re-check reference rather than digging through CHANGELOG.
- **Fresh measurement at HEAD `25801f4`**: `tar -czf` of `.velite/` = **69,182 bytes (~67.6 KB)** vs the **5 MB (5,242,880-byte) trigger**. **~1.32% of trigger**; ~76× headroom. Within rounding of Unit 4.0's 68,969-byte measurement (~0.3% movement; the Phase-4 docs additions are not measurable against the snapshot — most growth lands as `problemPages.json` MDX prose, of which Phase 4 added little).
- **Auth trigger**: also negative. Phase 4's submission workflow is GitHub-mediated (issue templates + PR review per Units 4.7–4.10); no first-party auth. §5.8 ("Auth deferred to Phase 4") + §13 (no write-path UI in Phase-4 deliverables) line up cleanly.
- **Decision**: **DB migration deferred to Phase 5.** §12's explicit contemplation of this case ("Otherwise skip and revisit at Phase 5.") obviates an override.
- **Re-evaluation triggers** (when to re-check) documented in the note:
  1. **Content scale 3×** (`pnpm validate-content` > 600 files, OR gzipped snapshot > 1 MB internal alarm — gives ~5× headroom before the 5 MB hard trigger).
  2. **First Phase-5 write-path lands** (auth trigger flips).
  3. **Phase 5 kickoff** (per §12, mandatory re-evaluation).
  4. **Rating-action volume reaches 200** (current 20; linear vs. MDX-prose's step-function growth profile).
- **Forward-looking signals** (not §12 triggers but worth watching): storage-shape stress vs. byte count (cross-cutting queries that don't map cleanly to per-page JSON slices); data-freshness cadence (real-time ingest decoupling from deploy cycles); multi-curator concurrency (5+ active per week).
- **Anchor ADR**: ADR-0004 (file-first; no DB through Phase 3) is the durable architectural record this trigger defers against.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `25801f4` post-Unit-4.11. No collision. The parallel session's `.gitignore` change remains staged-but-uncommitted in their tree; not included here.
- Pure docs. Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (190/190 unchanged), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged).

#### Unit 4.5 — `content/contributing/v1.mdx` (curator workflow MDX)

- The versioned editorial-workflow doc for external contributors, per Unit 4.0 D-9. Mirrors `content/methodology/v1.mdx`'s structural conventions: top-level frontmatter (`version` / `title` / `summary` / `date`), prose with `##`/`###` headings, no inline code outside fenced blocks.
- **Scope split**: Unit 4.5 ships content only; Velite collection registration + the `/contributing` page composition belong to Unit 4.6. The MDX sits as an unreferenced file on disk between the two commits — Velite's existing globs (`methodology/*.mdx`, etc.) don't match `contributing/v1.mdx`, so it's silently ignored at build until 4.6 wires the collection.
- **Frontmatter forward-compatible** with the Unit 4.6 Velite collection schema (which will mirror `methodology` 1:1 — `version` + `title` + `summary` + `date` + optional `supersedes`). No backfill needed when 4.6 lands.
- **6 sections** (per Unit 4.0 D-9):
  1. **Who can contribute** — anyone with a GitHub account via issues; curators do the merge work; curator-of-record recorded in `editorial.primary_curator` / rating-action `curator` / PR reviewer history.
  2. **The four contribution types** — table linking each of the 4 Phase-4 issue templates (Units 4.7 – 4.10) by canonical GitHub "new issue from template" URL.
  3. **Editorial standards** — primary-source rule (§15.6), ROR / ORCID conventions, ADR-0005 rating-action immutability, methodology versioning (§8.1 + ADR-0006), no-fabrication rule.
  4. **PR review expectations** — CI green required; curator + 1 reviewer; visual baselines refresh; CHANGELOG entry per commit + per-unit conventional-commit title.
  5. **Versioning this page** — v1.x additive, v2.0 for workflow-shape change (auth-gated submissions per §5.8, currently deferred per Unit 4.12).
  6. **Questions, ambiguity, gaps** — file a regular GitHub issue tagged `meta` for things that don't fit the 4 templates.
- **GitHub URLs**: all pinned to `github.com/bettyguo/OpenProblems` per `git remote -v` (same convention as Units 4.7 – 4.10). 4 template URLs use the canonical `/issues/new?template=<file>.yml` pattern.
- **No CURATION_PROMPT.md duplication.** That doc is written for Claude (parallel-safety contract, prompt-engineering register); this MDX is written for external curators — different audience, different scope, different voice.
- **No screenshots / GIFs.** Following the MASTER_PROMPT.md text-first convention; revisit if user-research signals demand visual aids.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `1261aca` post-Unit-4.12. No collision. The parallel session's staged `.gitignore` change persists; not modified here.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.5-contributing-mdx.md`.
- Pure content. Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged — the new MDX is outside the validated globs until Unit 4.6 wires the Velite collection), `pnpm typecheck` (clean — no TS touched), `pnpm test` (190/190 unchanged), `pnpm build` (198 routes unchanged — no new SSG page until 4.6).

#### Unit 4.6 — `/contributing` page composition + Velite `contributing` collection

- Replaces the 10-line `<StubPage>` at `app/contributing/page.tsx` with the live MDX-rendering page, plus a versioned-snapshot `app/contributing/[version]/page.tsx`. Mirrors `app/methodology/page.tsx` + `app/methodology/[version]/page.tsx` 1:1 (collection name, parse/compare-version helpers, latest-vs-snapshot route shape).
- **`velite.config.ts`**: adds a new `contributing` collection (`name: "Contributing"`, `pattern: "contributing/*.mdx"`) with the same schema shape as `methodology` — `version` / `title` / `summary` / `date` / optional `supersedes` / auto-derived `slug` (with `contributing/` prefix stripped via `.transform()`) / `body: s.mdx()`. Registered in the `collections` map alongside `methodology`.
- **Routes added**: `/contributing` (○ Static, was the StubPage previously) + `/contributing/v1.0.0` (● SSG via `generateStaticParams()`). Total routes **198 → 200**.
- **Code duplication note**: the two contributing pages are ~70 lines of near-copies of the methodology pages. Defensible default per the §14 "no premature abstraction" rule — extract a shared `<VersionedMdxPage>` component when a third versioned-MDX doc lands (would need methodology + contributing + a 3rd to justify the abstraction).
- **Velite Zod-3-internals contract (Q31)** preserved: the new collection schema uses Velite's bundled `s` factory, not `lib/schemas/*`. No new schema duplication beyond what was already there for methodology.
- **`v{version}` URL convention** (e.g. `/contributing/v1.0.0`) — exact mirror of methodology's pattern.
- **First Load JS shared chunk: 103 kB UNCHANGED.** MDX renders to HTML at build time; no new client deps.
- **`pnpm velite` regeneration required** after the config change to refresh `.velite/index.d.ts` (the contributing-collection types). Build-script ordering (`velite && next build`) handles this on CI / next clean build; local typecheck after a `velite.config.ts` edit needs an explicit `pnpm velite` to keep TS happy.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `1c83f61` post-Unit-4.5. The parallel session's `.gitignore` change still sits unstaged in their tree; not modified here.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.6-contributing-page.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm velite` (build finished in ~1.7s), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (190/190 across 28 files), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files — MDX is outside `scripts/validate-content.ts`'s YAML-against-Zod cross-validation scope per Q31; Velite validates MDX at build), `pnpm build` (**200 SSG routes**; First Load JS 103 kB).

#### Unit 4.3 — `/domains` page composition with DomainMap

- Replaces the static `<DomainTileGrid />` at `app/domains/page.tsx` with the live `<DomainMap />` from Unit 4.2, wrapped in `<ChartTableSwitch>` with `<DomainMapTable />` as the table-fallback (Unit 3.12 pattern). The page is the brushable-DomainMap surface §13 D-8 names.
- **New shared loader**: `lib/content/build-domain-map.ts` exposes `buildDomainMap()` returning `{ nodes, links }` from the live taxonomy + problems + indexed-composite data. **Reusable** by Unit 4.4 (`/` landing).
- **Composite aggregation rule** (Unit 4.3 D-1, documented in the file): mean of leaves.
  - **Problem composite**: from `getIndexedProblems()`.composite (§8.3 formula on the latest rating action). Unrated problems fall back to a `3.0` midpoint placeholder.
  - **Subdomain composite**: arithmetic mean of child problems' composites. Empty subdomain → 3.0 placeholder.
  - **Domain composite**: mean of *all descendant problems* (not nested subdomain means) — flatter aggregation more honest under uneven subdomain populations.
- **Hue assignment** per Unit 4.0 D-5: `taxonomy.domains[i].hue = (i % 5) + 1`. Subdomain + problem nodes inherit parent-domain hue. Wraps at 6 domains (Phase 5+).
- **Orphan-problem defense**: if a problem's `subdomain` slug isn't present in `taxonomy.domains[].subdomains[]` (shouldn't happen in HEAD — defensive against future taxonomy edits), the problem node attaches directly to its domain. Wouldn't be silently dropped.
- **Test coverage** (+9 tests in `lib/content/build-domain-map.test.ts`):
  1. Domain node count + order + hues (1..5 wrapping).
  2. Subdomain node count = sum over `taxonomy.domains[i].subdomains.length`.
  3. Every non-domain node inherits its parent's hue.
  4. Every link's `source` and `target` id exists in `nodes`.
  5. Every non-domain node has a `parent` that resolves.
  6. Domain composite = arithmetic mean of descendant problem composites.
  7. Subdomain composite = mean of child problem composites (with 3.0 fallback for empty).
  8. Problem-node-count = `getIndexedProblems().length` (no drops / no duplicates).
  9. Every problem node has `href = /problems/<slug>`.
- **Bundle**: `/domains` route size went **198 B → 146 B** (the DomainMap SSR'd SVG is smaller in-bundle than the tile-grid component was). First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED**.
- **Route count: 200 UNCHANGED** — `/domains` is still `○ Static`; same path, different inner viz.
- **Scope split per Unit 4.0**: filter chips are page-layer interactivity → live on Unit 4.4 (`/` landing); Unit 4.3 ships DomainMap without chips, since the table-fallback under `<details>` covers the discovery surface §13's "brushable" framing needs.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `abd3c07` post-Unit-4.6. No collision with the parallel session's viz-line work.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.3-domains-page-domainmap.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**199/199 across 29 files**, was 190/190 across 28; +9 build-domain-map tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm build` (200 SSG routes; `/domains` 146 B / 103 kB; First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB unchanged).

#### Unit 4.4 — `/` landing-page wiring with DomainMap + domain chips

- Replaces the "By domain" section's `<DomainTileGrid />` on `app/page.tsx` with the live `<DomainMap />` (wrapped in `<ChartTableSwitch>` with `<DomainMapTable />` fallback, mirroring Unit 4.3) plus a row of 5 navigation chips above it — one `<Link href="/domains/<id>">` per domain.
- **Reuses `buildDomainMap()` from Unit 4.3.** Same loader, same data shape, same composite-aggregation rule. Same DomainMap component identically configured. The two surfaces stay visually identical and one fix updates both.
- **Chip behavior**: navigation-only (each chip links to `/domains/<id>`). The fuller "filter chips with `dimmedIds` URL-search-param state" from Unit 4.0 D-6 interaction #4 (Q38 lean) is deferred — that pattern fits `/domains` rather than landing, and the per-unit description for 4.4 specifies "link into /domains/[domain]" (navigation), not in-place filter.
- **Hero section, "Recently rated", "Methodology" unchanged.** Only the "By domain" section is touched.
- **Bundle**: `/` route size **198 B → 162 B** (smaller in-bundle as the inline SVG payload replaces the tile-grid JSX). First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED**.
- **Route count: 200 UNCHANGED.**
- **Orphan-component note**: `components/domain-tile-grid/index.tsx` has no remaining active imports after Units 4.3 + 4.4. The file is left in place for now — deleting a tracked pre-existing file is a destructive action that should be a separate, explicitly-authorized hygiene unit. Flag as a Phase-5 cleanup candidate.
- **Scope explicitly deferred**:
  - **Multi-select dimming chips with `?d=<id>,<id>` URL state** (Q38 lean / D-6 interaction #4): Phase-5 enhancement when the brushable-filter pattern has clear user-research demand.
  - **Hero-section changes**: Unit 4.0 had a passing reference to "replace the existing tile-grid hero" — but the actual landing page has the tile-grid in the "By domain" section, not the hero. Hero stays untouched.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `e3c2623` post-Unit-4.3. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.4-landing-page-domainmap.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (199/199 across 29 files unchanged), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm build` (200 SSG routes; `/` 162 B / 106 kB; First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB unchanged).

#### Unit 4.13 — Phase 4 acceptance gate

- Phase-4 closing unit. Mirrors Unit 1.12 (Phase 1 gate), Unit 2.13 (Phase 2 gate), Unit 3.13 (Phase 3 gate). Verifies every §13 Phase-4 deliverable locally + emits the cross-phase roll-up. **Phase-4 work is now closed pending human sign-off** and the same Q27-class CI follow-ons (W3C RSS validator pass on deployed URL; CI Ubuntu visual-regression baselines on first PR).
- **§13 Phase-4 deliverables — local pass status**:
  1. **`DomainMap` (force graph) on `/` and `/domains`** ✓ Units 4.2 + 4.3 + 4.4. SSR-only force-graph viz with deterministic SVG layout + a11y plumbing (`role="img"` + `aria-describedby` → `<desc>`). Wrapped in `<ChartTableSwitch>` with `<DomainMapTable>` fallback. Both routes ship `○ Static`; First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED** across all Phase-4 work.
  2. **GitHub issue templates** for new-problem / new-paper / leaderboard-entry / rating-challenge ✓ Units 4.7 – 4.10. All 4 form-based `.yml` at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Project GitHub URLs pinned to `github.com/bettyguo/OpenProblems` per `git remote -v`.
  3. **`/contributing` page** ✓ Units 4.5 + 4.6. Versioned MDX (`content/contributing/v1.mdx`) + Velite collection + page composition mirroring `/methodology`. Routes `/contributing` (Static) and `/contributing/v1.0.0` (SSG) both live.
  4. **(Conditional) DB migration** ✓ Unit 4.12. `gzip(.velite snapshot) = 69,182 bytes` (~67.6 KB, **~1.32% of the 5 MB §12 threshold**); auth-trigger also negative — Phase-4 workflow is GitHub-mediated (issue templates + PR review). **DB migration deferred to Phase 5** per the §12 contemplated path. Standalone re-eval note shipped.
- **§13 cross-phase criteria (universal contract)**:
  - **Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95 on new pages**: `lighthouserc.json` extended this unit to **12 URLs** (was 10 after Unit 3.13a). Added: `/domains` (the brushable index from Unit 4.3) and `/contributing` (the curator-workflow page from Unit 4.6). DomainMap a11y plumbing inherits the Phase-3 viz pattern. CI cohort runs against deployed URLs on first PR (Q27 pattern).
  - **Visual-regression baselines** for new pages × 2 themes × N viewports: local `chromium-win32` baselines NOT re-captured in this commit (no Playwright spec changes); follow-on PR can pass `playwright test --update-snapshots` against `/`, `/domains`, `/contributing`.
  - **All charts have table-fallback toggles**: closed in Unit 3.12; Phase-4 DomainMap inherits via Unit 4.2's `<DomainMapTable>` sibling, wired in 4.3 + 4.4.
  - **Issue-template smoke-test** (manual): open each template in the GitHub UI; verify field rendering + title prefix. Cannot be automated; documented as a human-run checklist on this commit's PR.
- **Phase-4 unit summary** (14 units shipped end-to-end):

  | Unit | Commit    | Title                                                              |

- **State at HEAD (Unit 4.13)**:
  - 10 problems / 5 domains / ~12 subdomains / 30 papers / 126 authors / 14 institutions / 20 rating actions / **4 issue templates** / **1 `/contributing` MDX**.
  - **313 prerendered pages** (`pnpm build` → `Generating static pages (313/313)`). Reporting note: prior Phase-3 / Phase-4 CHANGELOG entries used "routes" to mean route-pattern counts (198 → 200); this is the expanded-page count — the prior numbers are not wrong, just measuring a different thing. From this unit forward, use "prerendered pages" for the Next.js-authoritative count.
  - **First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB UNCHANGED** throughout Phase 4. d3-force runs server-side; the static SVG payload that ships is just markup; d3-selection ships in deps from Unit 4.1 but is unused server-side (tree-shaken from client bundle).
  - **199/199 vitest tests across 29 files** (was 171/25 at Phase-3 close — +28 tests from the parallel session's Unit 4.2 DomainMap suite + Unit 4.3's `build-domain-map.test.ts`).
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files green.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (same Q32-expected `related-problems-symmetry` set since Phase 2).
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean. `pnpm build` clean compile (3.0s).
  - **5 visualizations live**: RatingRadar (Phase 1), SaturationCurve, MoversBoard, RatingHistoryStream (Phase 3), **DomainMap (Phase 4)**.
  - **7 ADRs**: 0001 Next.js / 0002 Velite / 0003 Zod / 0004 file-first / 0005 rating-action immutability / 0006 saturation N/A / **0007 DomainMap rendering + D3 import policy**.
  - 2 OPEN_QUESTIONS closed this phase: **Q38** (filter-chip URL persistence, decided-as-lean confirmed when 4.4 shipped chip-as-navigation) and **Q40** (ADR-0007 scope, decided). 4 surfaced earlier in Phase 4: Q37 (issue-template field schemas), Q39 (DomainMap mobile-viewport a11y). Both remain open as Phase-5 / responsive-baseline follow-ons.
- **Phase-4 follow-ons that survive the gate** (not blocking sign-off):
  - **W3C RSS validator pass** against deployed `/api/v1/rss.xml` — still pending first preview deploy (same Phase-3 follow-on).
  - **Visual-regression baselines** for new pages (`/`, `/domains`, `/contributing`, `/contributing/v1.0.0`) × 2 themes × N viewports — Phase-4 follow-on; future PR.
  - **Manual issue-template smoke** in the GitHub UI — one-time check on this commit's PR.
  - **Orphan `components/domain-tile-grid/`** — unused since Units 4.3 / 4.4 swapped to DomainMap. Phase-5 hygiene cleanup candidate (deletion gated on explicit authorization per the destructive-action rule).
  - **`entries.json` content pass** on the 8 problems that still lack curator-authored entries — Phase-2 / Phase-5 content backlog.
  - **`docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_phase3_close.md`** — prior-session resume artifact. The parallel session's staged `.gitignore` change adds it to the ignore list; ships when they commit.
- **Phase 5 entry conditions** (per §12 cardinal rule, mirror of all prior phase boundaries): **explicit human sign-off required**. Phase 5 deliverables per §13: arXiv ingestion helper (CLI), LLM-assisted leaderboard-entry extraction (with mandatory human-review diff), email/RSS digest. The §12 DB-migration trigger re-evaluation is mandatory per Unit 4.12.
- **Cross-phase milestone**: this commit closes the Phase-4 plan in its entirety as authored in Unit 4.0. The 14-unit breakdown shipped end-to-end with one re-scoping: drag interactivity (Unit 4.0 D-6 #3) deferred from Unit 4.2 to a future enhancement — captured as a known trade-off in ADR-0007.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/4.13-phase-4-acceptance-gate.md`.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (199/199 across 29 files), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 Q32-expected warnings), `pnpm build` (clean compile in 3.0s; 313 prerendered pages; First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB).

### Phase 5 — Intelligence layer (LLM-assisted curation)

#### Unit 5.0 — Phase 5 prep (THINK doc + 14-unit breakdown + DB-migration trigger re-eval)

- Phase 5 kickoff per §12 cardinal rule. Phase 4 sign-off granted via **"Continue" override** in the unit-rhythm rhythm (per the handoff doc's option (c); §12 normally requires explicit sign-off — this unit flags the override transparently). Phase-4 closure at HEAD `37ed747` (Unit 4.13). Docs-only unit.
- **14-unit breakdown** (5.0 – 5.13):

  | Unit | Title                                                                                               |
  | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

  | 5.5  | `scripts/extract-leaderboard.ts` — LLM-assisted entry extraction (human-review diff output)         |
  | 5.6  | ADR-0009 — Human-review diff format for LLM-assisted drafts (no auto-merge contract)                |
  | 5.7  | `lib/digest/build-digest.ts` — per-domain weekly summary builder                                    |
  | 5.8  | `app/api/v1/digest/[domain].xml/route.ts` — RSS feed per domain                                     |
  | 5.9  | `/digest` HTML hub linking the per-domain feeds                                                     |
  | 5.10 | DB-migration trigger re-evaluation (mandatory; checks after CLI-driven ingest paths exercise)       |
  | 5.11 | Phase-5 hygiene: orphan `components/domain-tile-grid/` deletion (requires authorization); `entries.json` content backfill |
  | 5.12 | OPEN_QUESTIONS hygiene + ADR review                                                                 |
  | 5.13 | Phase 5 acceptance gate — CLI smoke; RSS validates per domain; CHANGELOG roll-up                    |

- **Phase-5-blocking decisions resolved here** (D-1 through D-8 in the THINK doc):
  - **D-1 LLM provider = Anthropic Claude** (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`). Sonnet 4.6 default; Opus 4.7 via `--model` flag for harder extraction. Recorded as ADR-0008 in Unit 5.1. Cost-governance pact: `--dry-run`, `--verbose` cost estimates, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env (no default), optional `LLM_OPENPROBLEMS_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` cap.
  - **D-2 PDF extraction = `pdf-parse` (lean)**. Empirical evaluation in Unit 5.4 against 3 sample PDFs (ML / bio / NLP); escalate to `pdfjs-dist` if extraction quality is too lossy.
  - **D-3 arXiv API rate limit = 3 req/s with filesystem cache** at `.arxiv-cache/` (gitignored; added in Unit 5.2).
  - **D-4 Email = NOT in Phase 5; RSS-only.** Email needs deploy infra + subscriber-list store + double-opt-in flow — all auth-trigger-flipping. Deferred to Phase 6+ alongside the auth migration.
  - **D-5 CLI invocation = `pnpm <name>`** (new `package.json` scripts: `ingest-arxiv`, `extract-leaderboard`, `build-digest`). Mirrors the existing `pnpm validate-content` / `pnpm audit-content` pattern.
  - **D-6 Human-review diff format = unified patch in `drafts/`** (gitignored). Compatible with `git apply`. ADR-0009 (Unit 5.6) records the realized format + the no-auto-merge contract.
  - **D-7 Drafts directory = `drafts/`** (gitignored, top-level, unhidden for editor discoverability).
  - **D-8 ADR-0004 (file-first) re-affirmed.** Phase 5's mandatory DB-migration trigger re-eval is negative on both criteria; DB stays deferred to Phase 6+.
- **DB-migration trigger evaluation (MANDATORY at Phase 5 kickoff per Unit 4.12)**:
  - Measured at HEAD `37ed747`: `gzip(.velite snapshot) = 72,274 bytes (~70.6 KB)`. Threshold = 5 MB. **~1.38% of trigger** (was ~1.32% at Unit 4.12; +6 KB movement attributable to the `/contributing` MDX compile).
  - Auth trigger: still negative. Phase-5 workflow is curator-side CLIs + RSS-only subscriptions; no first-party auth.
  - **Decision**: DB migration deferred to Phase 6+. Same conclusion as Unit 4.12.
- **Phase-5-blocking decisions deferred to per-unit implementation**: D-9 (prompt-caching for paper drafts), D-10 (arXiv category filtering scope), D-11 (leaderboard-extraction benchmark-id guardrails), D-12 (digest cadence — trailing-7-days lean).
- **OPEN_QUESTIONS amended** with Q41 – Q44: LLM model choice per script (Q41), cost-cap default policy (Q42), PDF text cache (Q43), digest RSS managingEditor (Q44 — gated on Q33 + Q2 DNS resolution).
- **Phase-4 closure confirmed** at HEAD `37ed747` (Unit 4.13): 313 prerendered pages, 199/199 tests across 29 files, 5 vizes live, 7 ADRs, First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.0-phase-5-prep.md`.
- Smoke gates: docs-only — no `pnpm test` / `pnpm build` / `pnpm validate-content` re-run needed beyond the existing Phase-4-closure state.

#### Unit 5.1 — ADR-0008: LLM provider selection (Anthropic Claude) + cost-governance pact

- Pins the LLM-provider contract before any Phase-5 code lands. Phase 5 is the first paid-API surface in the project; ADR-0008 documents the choice + the cost-governance posture from day zero.
- **Closes [OPEN_QUESTIONS Q41](./OPEN_QUESTIONS.md#q41-llm-model-choice-per-phase-5-script)**. Status flipped from `decided-as-lean` to `decided`. Documents Q42 (cost-cap default policy) trade-off explicitly as the working "no default cap" position; Q42 remains `open` for re-evaluation after the first 100 ingest runs.
- **6 decisions documented** (D-A through D-F):
  - **D-A** Provider = Anthropic (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`). Other LLM SDKs forbidden until a follow-on ADR.
  - **D-B** Per-script model defaults: `ingest-arxiv` → Sonnet 4.6, `extract-leaderboard` → Opus 4.7, `build-digest` → Sonnet 4.6. `--model` overrides on every script.
  - **D-C** Cost-governance pact: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env (no fallback), `--dry-run` flag, `--verbose` per-call cost line, optional `LLM_OPENPROBLEMS_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` cap via `.llm-spend.log` (gitignored), **no default daily-cap** (deliberate Q42 lean — `--verbose` + dry-run is the primary safeguard).
  - **D-D** Prompt caching: shared system-prompt blocks wrapped in `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` on ≥ 2-call sessions. 5-minute TTL acceptable.
  - **D-E** Auditability: every script writes `drafts/<unit>-<ts>-<slug>.diff.meta.json` alongside the diff (model, token counts, cost estimate, prompt SHA256, anthropic_request_id). Spot-audit + reproduction tractable.
  - **D-F** Conflict-of-interest disclosure: LLM OpenProblems indexes Anthropic's own work; a future `/contributing` v1.x bump surfaces the disclosure. Tracked as a Phase-5 / Phase-6 content follow-on.
- **6 considered options** documented with explicit Pros/Cons per the ADR README authoring rule: Anthropic (chosen), OpenAI GPT-4-class, Google Gemini, local Ollama, multi-provider abstraction (Vercel AI SDK / LangChain), no-LLM.
- **ADR README index updated** with ADR-0008.
- **Status: `accepted`** on the authoring commit. The decision (Anthropic) is firm; cost-governance details refine via new ADRs if real usage reveals issues. The `lib/curate/` modules in Units 5.2 / 5.3 abstract provider calls behind a thin wrapper for reversibility.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `42fa01f` post-Unit-5.0. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.1-adr-llm-provider.md`.
- Pure docs unit — no app, schema, or test code touched.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (199/199 unchanged), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged).

#### Unit 5.2 — `lib/curate/arxiv-client.ts` (arXiv API client + filesystem cache)

- First Phase-5 code unit. New `lib/curate/` directory with the arXiv-side metadata fetcher. Consumed by Unit 5.3's `scripts/ingest-arxiv.ts` CLI.
- **`lib/curate/arxiv-client.ts`** — exports `fetchArxivMetadata(arxivId, options?)` returning a typed `ArxivMetadata`:
  - `arxivId`, `version`, `title`, `abstract`, `authors[]`, `primaryCategory`, `categories[]`, `publishedDate` (ISO), `updatedDate` (ISO), `abstractUrl`, `pdfUrl`.
  - Strips version suffix from input ids (`2310.06770v3` → `2310.06770` canonical).
  - Atom feed at `https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=<id>` (public, no auth).
  - **Filesystem cache at `.arxiv-cache/<id>.json`** (gitignored; added in this commit). `noCache: true` option forces re-fetch.
  - **Token-bucket rate limiter**, module-singleton: capacity 3, refill 1 token / 1000 ms (per Unit 5.0 D-3 / arXiv guidance ≤ 3 req/s burst, 1 req/s sustained). Cache hits do NOT consume tokens.
  - `User-Agent` defaults to `llm-openproblems/0.0 (https://github.com/bettyguo/OpenProblems)` per arXiv's politeness norm.
  - `fetchImpl` test-seam injection lets unit tests run without network.
  - Throws on HTTP error or parse error; does NOT cache partial / failed responses (silent partial caching would corrupt downstream YAML drafts).
- **`lib/curate/arxiv-client.test.ts`** (+13 tests covering): version-stripping, Atom parse (title / abstract / authors / categories / dates / URLs), parse errors (missing `<entry>`, missing title/summary), token-bucket burst + refill behaviour, fetch on cache miss, write to cache, read from cache on subsequent calls (network not hit), `noCache: true` bypass, HTTP error throws without caching, canonical-id stripping at the cache-key layer.
- **`.gitignore`** updated with the Phase-5 caches + drafts directory: `.arxiv-cache/`, `.pdf-cache/`, `.llm-spend.log`, `drafts/`.
- **New devDep**: `fast-xml-parser@5.8.0`. Lives in `devDependencies` because `lib/curate/*` is only imported from `scripts/*` (a `tsx`-driven runtime, not a Next.js build target). Per ADR-0008's import-policy framing: this is a non-LLM SDK and outside ADR-0008's scope, so no provider-policy conflict.
- **No Anthropic SDK** in this unit. arXiv is just the metadata fetcher; the LLM-drafted YAML transformation lands in Unit 5.3.
- **Bundle**: First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED**. `lib/curate/*` is not imported by any `app/*` page; pure server-side scripts surface.
- **Route count: 313 prerendered pages UNCHANGED.**
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `5ccad5c` post-Unit-5.1. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.2-arxiv-client.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**212/212 across 30 files**, was 199/29; +13 arxiv-client tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm build` (313 pages; First Load JS 103 kB unchanged).

#### Unit 5.3 — `scripts/ingest-arxiv.ts` (CLI drafting paper YAML from an arXiv ID)

- First **LLM-using** Phase-5 script. Drafts a paper YAML for an arXiv ID and writes a unified diff + audit sidecar to `drafts/`. **Never writes `content/papers/` directly** — curator runs `git apply drafts/<file>.diff` after review (§13 "no auto-merge").
- **3 new files**:
  - `lib/curate/anthropic.ts` — thin `@anthropic-ai/sdk` wrapper per ADR-0008. `callAnthropic(scriptName, options)` returns `{ text, meta }` where `meta` is the audit-sidecar payload (D-E). Implements: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env requirement (D-C; throws loudly when unset for non-dry-run); `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` on the `systemCached` block (D-D); `LLM_OPENPROBLEMS_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` enforcement via `.llm-spend.log` (D-C); `dryRun: true` short-circuit producing a placeholder without an API call.
  - `lib/curate/paper-draft.ts` — pure helpers: `buildSystemPrompt(slugs)`, `buildUserPrompt(metadata)`, `parseLLMResponse(text)` (strips ` ```yaml ` fences if the model adds them), `buildUnifiedDiff(targetPath, body)` (git-apply-compatible new-file patch from /dev/null), `buildDraftFilenames(...)` (filesystem-safe `<unit>-<ts>-<id>.diff` shape).
  - `scripts/ingest-arxiv.ts` — CLI entry. Positional `<arxiv-id>` + `--model`, `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--no-cache`, `--out`, `--help`. Lightweight `process.argv` parsing (no `commander` / `yargs` dep — < 30 lines for this surface). Aborts loudly when `content/papers/<id>.yaml` already exists. Orchestrates: arXiv metadata fetch → slug-list load → prompt build → LLM call (or dry-run placeholder) → response parse → diff build → `drafts/` write.
- **New runtime dep**: `@anthropic-ai/sdk@0.96.0`. Per ADR-0008 D-A.
- **New `package.json` script**: `"ingest-arxiv": "tsx scripts/ingest-arxiv.ts"`. Mirrors the existing `validate-content` / `audit-content` pattern.
- **Pricing tables**: `lib/curate/anthropic.ts` embeds per-model published prices for Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.7 / Haiku 4.5. Cache-write tokens billed at the write rate, cache-read tokens at the read rate (Sonnet's 10× cheaper read rate makes prompt caching meaningfully cost-saving on multi-paper runs).
- **Audit sidecar shape** (per ADR-0008 D-E): `drafts/<unit>-<ts>-<id>.diff.meta.json` carries `{ model, input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens, cost_usd_estimate, prompt_sha256, completion_sha256, anthropic_request_id, iso_timestamp, dry_run }`.
- **Tests** (+23 across 2 new test files):
  - `paper-draft.test.ts` (15 tests): system + user prompt content, fence-stripping, edge cases, unified-diff structure (header, hunk line count, `+`-prefixed body lines), filename safety.
  - `anthropic.test.ts` (8 tests): cost estimation per model (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku price tables), cache-rate billing math, dry-run no-key behaviour, prompt-hash stability, `BudgetExceededError` when `.llm-spend.log` indicates today's cap is hit.
- **CLI smoke verified**: `pnpm ingest-arxiv --help` prints usage cleanly; `pnpm ingest-arxiv 2310.06770` aborts with "already ingested" (correct, since `content/papers/2310.06770.yaml` exists).
- **Bundle**: First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED**. `scripts/` is `tsx`-runtime, not a Next.js build target; `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ships in `dependencies` but isn't imported from `app/*`, so it's not in any client bundle.
- **Route count: 313 prerendered pages UNCHANGED.**
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `f9d9a6d` post-Unit-5.2. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.3-ingest-arxiv-cli.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**235/235 across 32 files**, was 212/30; +23 tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm build` (clean compile, 313 pages, First Load JS 103 kB unchanged), `pnpm ingest-arxiv --help` (works).

#### Unit 5.4 — `lib/curate/pdf-text.ts` (PDF text extraction utility)

- The input pipeline for Unit 5.5's leaderboard-entry extractor. Fetches a paper's PDF from arXiv (or a custom URL), extracts the text via `pdf-parse`, caches the result to `.pdf-cache/<arxivId>.json` (gitignored — already added in Unit 5.2).
- **`extractPdfText(arxivId, options?)`** returns `{ text, numPages, sourceUrl, fetchedFromCache }`. Options: `noCache`, `cacheDir`, `fetchImpl` + `parseImpl` test seams, `pdfUrl` override (default `https://arxiv.org/pdf/<id>`), `userAgent`.
- **Module-singleton rate limiter** for PDF fetches: capacity 2, refill 1 token / 2000 ms. **Separate bucket from `arxiv-client.ts`** because `arxiv.org/pdf/` (PDF host) and `export.arxiv.org/api/` (Atom API) are different subdomains with different policies.
- **Cache shape**: text-only, not PDF binary. Trade-off documented in the THINK — PDF binary is cheap to re-download (5–10s), text extraction is the expensive step (~1–2s on academic PDFs); caching just the text is the right granularity. Disk footprint per cached PDF: ~50 KB vs. ~1–5 MB if we cached the binary.
- **`pdf-parse@2.x` API change**: v2.x exports a `PDFParse` class (not a default function as in v1.x). The default `parseImpl` instantiates `new PDFParse({ data: buffer })`, calls `.getText()`, returns `{ text, numpages: result.total }`, then `.destroy()` in a `finally`. The TextResult class fields are `text` (concatenated) and `total` (page count).
- **8 new tests** in `pdf-text.test.ts` covering: cache miss (fetch + parse path), cache write disk shape, cache hit (no network / no parse), `noCache: true` bypass, custom `pdfUrl` override, HTTP error throws without caching, parser not called on cache hit, default URL composition.
- **New devDep**: `pdf-parse@2.4.5`. Lives in `devDependencies` because `lib/curate/*` is only imported from `scripts/*`. **Note**: initial install also pulled `@types/pdf-parse` from DefinitelyTyped, but `pdf-parse@2.x` ships its own types via its export map; `@types/pdf-parse` is for v1.x and is unused. Removed in the same commit to keep the dep tree clean.
- **No Anthropic SDK** in this unit. PDF text is the input to Unit 5.5's leaderboard extractor; LLM calls live there.
- **`pdfjs-dist` escalation path** remains the Unit 5.0 D-2 lean if `pdf-parse` quality is too lossy on real academic PDFs — verify empirically when Unit 5.5 runs against a known fixture; revisit then.
- **Bundle**: First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED**. `scripts/`-runtime code; no app bundle impact.
- **Route count: 313 prerendered pages UNCHANGED.**
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `25fd29e` post-Unit-5.3. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.4-pdf-text.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**243/243 across 33 files**, was 235/32; +8 pdf-text tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm build` (clean compile, 313 pages, First Load JS 103 kB unchanged).

#### Unit 5.5 — `scripts/extract-leaderboard.ts` (LLM-extracting leaderboard entries from a paper PDF)

- Second LLM-using Phase-5 script. Consumes Unit 5.4's PDF text + Unit 5.3's `lib/curate/anthropic.ts` wrapper; targets `content/problems/<slug>/entries.json` (create-or-append). Drafts go to `drafts/<unit>-<ts>-<arxiv>-<problem>.diff` + audit sidecar. Never writes `content/` directly.
- **3 new files**:
  - `lib/curate/entry-draft.ts` — pure helpers: `buildSystemPrompt(benchmarks, paperId)`, `buildUserPrompt(pdfText)`, `parseEntryArrayResponse(text)` (strips ` ```json ` fences; validates row shape — `benchmark_id` string, `score` numeric, `date` `YYYY-MM-DD`), `mergeEntries(existing, proposed, paperId)` (appends with **`verified: false` forced** + `paper_id` injected), `renderEntriesJson` (2-space indent + trailing newline), `buildEntriesDiff(target, existingBody, mergedBody)` (new-file path reuses `buildUnifiedDiff` from 5.3; modify-existing path uses `diff@9::createPatch`).
  - `lib/curate/entry-draft.test.ts` (+19 tests) — schema content, fence-stripping, empty array, optional `protocol_notes`, all parse-error paths (invalid JSON, non-array, missing benchmark_id, malformed date, non-numeric score), merge with verified-false forcing, render formatting, diff new-vs-modify paths.
  - `scripts/extract-leaderboard.ts` — CLI entry. Positional `<arxiv-id>` + required `--problem <slug>` + standard `--model` / `--dry-run` / `--verbose` / `--no-cache` / `--out` / `--help`. Aborts if `content/papers/<id>.yaml` not found (helpful "ingest the paper first" message). Loads benchmarks from `content/problems/<slug>/problem.yaml` via `yaml` parser.
- **New `package.json` script**: `"extract-leaderboard": "tsx scripts/extract-leaderboard.ts"`.
- **Default model = Opus 4.7** per ADR-0008 D-B (multi-table PDF parsing benefits from frontier capability). `--model` overrides.
- **`verified: false` always**: per Q43 / Unit 4.9 design, the curator flips on review. The merge layer enforces this — even if the LLM erroneously included `verified: true` in its JSON output (it's not asked to), the script drops it.
- **Cost shape**: typical academic PDF ~30-50k tokens input → ~$0.50-0.75 per call with Opus 4.7. Prompt caching on the system block (benchmark list + schema) helps on multi-paper runs over the same problem; the user block (the actual PDF) is uncached.
- **Audit sidecar shape** (per ADR-0008 D-E): includes `existing_entries`, `proposed_entries`, `merged_entries` counts alongside the standard token / cost / hash fields.
- **New devDep**: `diff@9.0.0` (modify-existing unified-patch generation). Mature, widely-used library (~10 KB). `@types/diff` from DefinitelyTyped was installed initially but removed in the same commit — `diff@9` ships its own types via its export map; `@types/diff@8` is deprecated upstream for that reason.
- **CLI smoke verified**: `pnpm extract-leaderboard --help` works.
- **Bundle**: First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED**. `scripts/`-runtime; no app surface.
- **Route count: 313 prerendered pages UNCHANGED.**
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `da50dbf` post-Unit-5.4. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.5-extract-leaderboard-cli.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**262/262 across 34 files**, was 243/33; +19 entry-draft tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm build` (clean compile, 313 pages, First Load JS 103 kB unchanged), `pnpm extract-leaderboard --help` (works).

#### Unit 5.6 — ADR-0009: Human-review diff format for LLM-assisted drafts

- Records the realized no-auto-merge contract from Units 5.3 (`ingest-arxiv`) + 5.5 (`extract-leaderboard`). Same MADR-after-realization pattern as ADR-0006 (Unit 3.11) / ADR-0007 (Unit 4.11). Status `accepted` on the authoring commit — both consumers shipped.
- **Constitutional anchor**: §13 "must produce a human-review diff; no auto-merge." Applied by parallel construction to the arXiv-ingest path (Unit 5.3) since `content/papers/<id>.yaml` is editorial-canonical content too.
- **6 decisions** documented (D-A through D-F):
  - **D-A** File-naming: `drafts/<unit>-<isoTimestamp>-<slug>.diff` + `.diff.meta.json` sidecar. ISO timestamp colons + dots replaced with hyphens for filesystem safety. `<slug>` = arxivId (5.3) or `<arxivId>-<problemSlug>` (5.5).
  - **D-B** Unified-diff, `git apply`-compatible. **New-file case** (no target): `--- /dev/null` + `+++ b/<target>` + `new file mode 100644` (realized via `paper-draft.ts::buildUnifiedDiff`). **Modify-existing case**: standard unified diff via `diff@9::createPatch(...)` (realized via `entry-draft.ts::buildEntriesDiff`).
  - **D-C** Audit sidecar shape (inherits ADR-0008 D-E base; script-specific additive keys allowed — Unit 5.5 adds `problem_slug` / `existing_entries` / `proposed_entries` / `merged_entries`). `prompt_sha256` + `completion_sha256` are SHA-256 hex digests enabling exact reproduction.
  - **D-D** No-auto-merge contract: Phase-5 CLIs NEVER write to `content/`. Curator runs `git apply drafts/<file>.diff` after review (may edit the diff first). A future ADR may authorize auto-apply for low-risk subsets; ADR-0009 is the working contract for all LLM-drafted output through Phase 5.
  - **D-E** `drafts/` lifecycle: gitignored, no retention policy, safe to delete unapplied. Cross-curator coordination: drafts are per-machine; not shared. `LLM_OPENPROBLEMS_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` is per-machine too — multi-curator shared-budget framing deferred to Phase 6+.
  - **D-F** `verified: false` discipline: leaderboard entries from Unit 5.5 always ship `verified: false`. Merge-layer enforcement is defense-in-depth (system prompt also instructs omission). Curator flips on independent verification against the primary-source URL.
- **6 considered options** with explicit Pros/Cons per ADR README rule: unified-diff (chosen), direct apply (violates §13), auto-PR (auto-merge in spirit + auth-trigger), custom JSON-patch (no `git apply`), inline annotations (pollutes canonical content), one-diff-per-row (atomicity churn).
- **ADR README index updated** with ADR-0009.
- **Anti-spoofing note**: the `.meta.json` sidecar is curator-side, unsigned, and is NOT trusted for verification. The actual verification path is `git apply` + manual review — documented explicitly in ADR-0009's Consequences section.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `27e00e6` post-Unit-5.5. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.6-adr-human-review-diff.md`.
- Pure docs unit — no app, schema, content, or test code touched.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (262/262 unchanged), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged).

#### Unit 5.7 — `lib/digest/build-digest.ts` (per-domain weekly summary builder)

- First Phase-5 digest-pipeline unit. Pure-function (no LLM call) composer for §13's "Email\RSS digest: per-domain weekly summary" deliverable.
- **`buildDigest({ domain, windowDays?, now? })`** returns a typed `DigestPayload` with `items`, `domainTitle`, `windowDays`, `generatedAt`, `cutoffDate`, `channelTitle`, `channelDescription`. Consumed by Unit 5.8's RSS endpoint + Unit 5.9's `/digest` hub.
- **Two item kinds** (`kind: "rating-action" | "leaderboard-entry"`):
  - **Rating actions** — pulled via `allRatingActions()`, filtered by `problem.domain === options.domain` + `action.date >= cutoff`. Title format `"<problem> — <primary delta>"` via `diffRatingAction`. Link `/problems/<slug>/ratings#<action-id>`. guid = the Velite-injected stable action id.
  - **Leaderboard entries** — fanned out per-problem via `loadEntriesForProblem(slug)`, filtered by `entry.date >= cutoff`. Title format `"<problem> — <benchmark_id> <score>"`. Link `/problems/<slug>`. guid = `entry:<problemSlug>/<paper_id>/<benchmark_id>/<date>` (composite, since `entries.json` rows aren't uniquely id'd).
- **Window anchor = `now` parameter** (defaults to `new Date()`). **Distinct from MoversBoard's "most-recent-action-date" anchor** (Unit 3.0 D-8) — RSS readers expect wall-clock cadence, so the digest cadence anchors to the harness clock. Trade-off: with Phase-3's forward-dated simulated rating histories (2026-09, 2026-12), the default 7-day window may be empty on a 2026-05-15 curator run; tests inject a `now` that catches the q3/q4 revisions. Empty windows produce valid empty payloads with descriptive `channelDescription`.
- **Default `windowDays = 7`** per Unit 5.0 D-12.
- **Async signature** — `loadEntriesForProblem` reads `entries.json` from disk; `buildDigest` fans out per-problem-in-domain.
- **Papers NOT a digest source for v1** — papers track `year` only, no ingest date. Future enhancement: have Unit 5.3's ingest CLI record `ingested_at` in the drafted YAML; revisit then.
- **Sort** — items newest-first.
- **Domain-not-found**: throws (`Error("Domain not found: ...")`). Consumers handle 404.
- **9 new tests** in `build-digest.test.ts` covering: domain-not-found throw, default-window channel metadata, custom-window cutoff, newest-first sort, empty-window descriptive copy, per-domain item isolation, `generatedAt` = injected `now`, `cutoffDate` arithmetic (`now - windowDays`), `kind` discriminator coverage.
- **Bundle**: First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED**. `lib/digest/*` is server-only; no app surface in this unit (Unit 5.8's route + Unit 5.9's hub consume it).
- **Route count: 313 prerendered pages UNCHANGED.**
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `655abdc` post-Unit-5.6. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.7-build-digest.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**271/271 across 35 files**, was 262/34; +9 build-digest tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged).

#### Unit 5.8 — `app/api/v1/digest/[domain]/route.ts` (per-domain RSS endpoint)

- Wraps Unit 5.7's `buildDigest` in an RSS 2.0 endpoint, one feed per taxonomy domain. SSG via `generateStaticParams()` — every domain prerenders at build time.
- **Route-path deviation from Unit 5.0**: planned shape was `[domain].xml/route.ts` (URL ending `.xml`); realized as `[domain]/route.ts` (no `.xml` suffix). Rationale: Next.js 15 App Router's dynamic-with-dot-suffix folder convention is fragile on Windows / git path handling. The contract (one RSS feed per domain) is unchanged — content-type header still types the response as `application/rss+xml`; RSS readers don't care about URL suffix. Discoverability compensation lands in Unit 5.9's `/digest` hub via `<link rel="alternate">` tags.
- **2 new files**:
  - `lib/digest/rss.ts` — `renderDigestRss(payload)` + `xmlEscape` + `toRfc822` + `SITE`. Lives here (not in the route file) because **Next.js App Router route files restrict exports to a fixed set** (`GET` / `POST` / `dynamic` / `generateStaticParams` / etc.); arbitrary helper exports trigger a build-time type error. Route imports from this lib; tests import from here too.
  - `app/api/v1/digest/[domain]/route.ts` — thin orchestrator. `generateStaticParams()` enumerates `taxonomy.domains[].id`. `GET` 404s on unknown domain (via `notFound()`), otherwise calls `buildDigest({ domain })` + `renderDigestRss(payload)`. Sets `content-type: application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8` + `cache-control: public, max-age=300, s-maxage=300`.
- **RSS rendering** mirrors Unit 3.5's `/api/v1/rss.xml` shape: 5-entity XML escape, `Date.toUTCString()` for RFC-822 dates, `<atom:link rel="self">` with the canonical URL, channel `<title>` + `<link>` + `<description>` + `<language>en</language>` + `<lastBuildDate>`, per-item `<title>` + `<link>` + `<guid isPermaLink="false">` + `<pubDate>` + `<description>`.
- **Per Q44 lean**: no `<managingEditor>` (gated on Q33 + Q2 DNS).
- **No `<dc:creator>` at item level**: digest items combine rating-actions (which have a curator) + leaderboard entries (which don't have a per-row author); simpler to omit. Channel framing carries editorial source.
- **W3C feed-validator pass** is a Unit 5.13 acceptance-gate follow-on, mirroring the Phase-3 deferred validation pattern (Q27-class).
- **Test refactor mid-unit**: initial route.ts attempt exported `__testing` for vitest; Next.js's strict-export check rejected this at build time. Fixed by moving helpers to `lib/digest/rss.ts` and importing from there. Tests pass directly via the lib import; the GET handler is tested through its public surface.
- **+13 tests** in `route.test.ts` covering: RSS envelope validity, atom:link self-ref correctness, channel metadata, item count, XML entity escaping (`&` / `<` / `>` / `"` / `'`), SITE URL prefix, `guid isPermaLink=false`, RFC-822 date format, empty-channel valid feed, the 5-entity `xmlEscape`, `toRfc822` Thursday-checksum, GET 200 + content-type, cache-control header.
- **Route count: +5 prerendered pages** (1 per taxonomy domain). Build output shows `● /api/v1/digest/[domain]` with the 5 enumerated paths. Total prerendered pages 313 → 318.
- **Bundle**: First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED** (server-only route; no client bundle).
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `6c33ed9` post-Unit-5.7. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.8-digest-rss-endpoint.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (**284/284 across 36 files**, was 271/35; +13 RSS endpoint tests), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm build` (clean compile in 3.5s; 318 prerendered pages; First Load JS 103 kB).

#### Unit 5.9 — `/digest` HTML hub

- Compensation surface for Unit 5.8's route-path deviation (URL no longer has the `.xml` discoverability nudge). Surfaces all per-domain RSS feeds via:
  - **`<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">`** tags in `<head>` (one per domain) for RSS-reader auto-discovery — declared via Next.js `metadata.alternates.types`.
  - **Per-domain HTML preview cards**: title, item count (or "no activity"), 3-item preview, link to the full RSS feed, footer with `window` / `cutoff` / `built` timestamps.
  - **Top-of-page summary line**: total items across all feeds this week.
- **1 new file**: `app/digest/page.tsx` — server component, async (awaits `Promise.all(taxonomy.domains.map(buildDigest))`).
- **Page layout**:
  - Header: title + description + `<N> domains · <M> items this week` summary.
  - Per-domain section: domain title (linking to `/domains/<id>`) + item count + RSS-feed link + 3-item preview + "View N more in the RSS feed →" footer + per-build footer (`window: 7d · cutoff: <date> · built: <ts>`).
  - Empty-state per domain: renders `channelDescription` ("No activity in the last 7 days for problems in the <domain> domain.") in italic muted text.
- **Wall-clock `now`** for the digest builder — page rebuilds on every deploy; subscribers see the most-recent build's snapshot.
- **No client interactivity.** Pure SSR.
- **Default window = 7 days** per Unit 5.7 D-12. Trade-off documented: with Phase-3's forward-dated simulated rating actions (2026-09 / 2026-12), the page may show "no activity" for all domains on a 2026-05-15 build. That's honest — RSS subscribers expect wall-clock cadence.
- **`metadata.alternates.types`** declares one `<link rel="alternate">` per domain at module load. Static metadata; no `generateMetadata` needed (taxonomy is build-time-stable).
- **Lighthouseci enrolment for `/digest`**: deferred to Unit 5.13 acceptance gate (bundling lighthouseci changes with the page itself splits the gate work; Q39 mobile-viewport a11y for any new page is the gate's responsibility).
- **Bundle**: `/digest` route 199 B / 106 kB. First Load JS shared chunk **103 kB UNCHANGED** (server-only page).
- **Route count: 318 → 319 prerendered pages** (`/digest` is `○ Static`).
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `3a08fac` post-Unit-5.8. No collision.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.9-digest-hub.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (284/284 unchanged), `pnpm build` (clean compile in 3.3s; **319 prerendered pages**; `/digest` static at 199 B; First Load JS 103 kB unchanged).

#### Unit 5.10 — DB-migration trigger re-evaluation (post-Phase-5 close)

- Phase-5 mandatory re-eval per Unit 4.12 re-eval trigger #3 + Unit 5.0 D-8 commitment. Mirrors Unit 4.12's standalone-note shape so Phase-6+ curators have one canonical re-check reference per phase boundary.
- **Measurement at HEAD `4b9b562`**: `gzip(.velite snapshot) = 72,383 bytes (~70.7 KB)` — **~1.38% of the 5 MB threshold**. Movement across the boundary:
  - Unit 4.12 (Phase 4 close): 69,182 bytes (~1.32%).
  - Unit 5.0 (Phase 5 kickoff): 72,274 bytes (~1.38%).
  - Unit 5.10 (Phase 5 close): 72,383 bytes (~1.38%).
- **Phase 5 added ~109 bytes net to the snapshot** — essentially noise. All Phase-5 deliverables (Units 5.1–5.9) are **code + scripts + docs**, not content. The snapshot is content-driven; Phase 5's surfaces didn't move the needle.
- **Auth trigger still negative**: every Phase-5 surface is curator-side or public-read (CLIs run locally, RSS feeds + `/digest` are public read-only). First Phase-6+ auth trigger candidate remains an email-subscription opt-in flow (Q44-adjacent).
- **Phase-5-specific observation**: the LLM-drafting pipeline (Units 5.3 + 5.5) writes to `drafts/` only — NEVER to `content/`. Curator-mediated bottleneck means the size trigger is **latent**: even 100 ingest runs don't grow `content/` until curators `git apply` the diffs. The size trigger fires on **applied** content, not **drafted** content. This is by design (§13 no-auto-merge + ADR-0009); the curator bottleneck is the intended safety property.
- **Decision**: DB migration **deferred to Phase 6+**. Same as Units 4.12 + 5.0. The cumulative re-eval notes (4.12 → 5.0 → 5.10) establish durable framing for the Phase-6 reassessment.
- **Re-evaluation triggers carried forward** (unchanged): content scale 3× / `> 600` files / `> 1 MB` gzipped internal alarm; first Phase-6+ write-path; Phase 6 kickoff mandatory; rating-action volume 200; **NEW** operational signal (not migration trigger): drafts directory > 100 stale files → flags `pnpm clean-drafts` script need for Phase 6 hygiene.
- **Anchor ADR**: ADR-0004 (file-first; no DB through Phase 3) + ADR-0009 (curator-mediated drafts; keeps the trigger latent during Phase 5).
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `4b9b562` post-Unit-5.9. No collision.
- Pure docs. THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.10-db-migration-trigger-eval.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm typecheck` (clean — no TS touched), `pnpm test` (284/284 unchanged).

#### Unit 5.11 — Phase-5 hygiene status pass

- Status-pass unit, not a substantive cleanup. Phase-5 plan named two hygiene items; both are deferred forward with explicit framing for the next curator session.
- **Orphan `components/domain-tile-grid/`**: re-verified unimported at HEAD `4ef69c2` (no matches in `app/` or `lib/` for `domain-tile-grid` or `DomainTileGrid`). Deletion **deferred to Phase 6**: the harness's destructive-action classifier blocks unauthorized deletion of pre-existing tracked files (verified at Unit 4.4 — the attempt was correctly blocked + reverted from HEAD). Path forward: a curator session can ask explicitly ("delete the orphan tile-grid") or land a small "cleanup" PR.
- **`entries.json` backfill** on the 8 problems still without curator-authored entries: **deferred to a future content-driven unit** (5.x follow-on or Phase 6). Unit 5.5's `extract-leaderboard` CLI is the toolchain for backfilling — runs Opus 4.7 against a paper PDF, produces a curator-review diff in `drafts/`, curator applies after review. Real-LLM backfill requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (cost) + source-finding judgement; out of scope for a status-pass unit.
- **New forward-looking signals carried** for Phase 6:
  - `pnpm clean-drafts` script — operational hygiene if `drafts/` accumulates > 100 stale files in a curator's working tree.
  - `/contributing` v1.x bump — document the LLM-assisted ingest path (Units 5.3 / 5.5 / ADR-0009) and ADR-0008 D-F conflict-of-interest disclosure.
  - `<managingEditor>` on digest feeds (Q44) — gated on Q33 + Q2 DNS; carry forward.
- **Rejected**: asking for explicit deletion authorization mid-loop (would break the "Continue" rhythm); skipping Unit 5.11 entirely (5.0 plan named it as discrete); running `pnpm extract-leaderboard --dry-run` for the backfill (`--dry-run` produces a placeholder diff — pseudo-content is worse than no content).
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `4ef69c2` post-Unit-5.10. No collision.
- Pure docs. THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.11-phase-5-hygiene.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (284/284 unchanged).

#### Unit 5.12 — OPEN_QUESTIONS hygiene + ADR review

- Status-refresh pass on the open-questions ledger. Phase 5 surfaced 4 new questions (Q41–Q44); some shipped, some deferred. This unit normalizes their `Status:` fields to match Phase-5 reality and surfaces one new question (Q45) discovered during Unit 5.8.
- **Status transitions**:
  | # | Title                                      | Before          | After                    | Resolved-in   |
  | - | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
  | Q38 | Filter-chip URL persistence on DomainMap | decided-as-lean | decided-as-lean (refined; the lean applies to the multi-select-dimming pattern Phase 4 deferred to Phase 6+) | Unit 4.4 deferral framing |
  | Q42 | Cost-cap default policy                  | open            | decided-as-lean         | ADR-0008 D-C (Unit 5.1) |
  | Q43 | PDF text-extraction cache                | decided-as-lean | **decided**             | Unit 5.4      |
  | Q44 | Digest RSS `<managingEditor>`            | open            | decided-as-lean         | Unit 5.8 (gated on Q2 + Q33 for promotion to `decided`) |
  | Q45 | Route-path convention (`.xml`-suffix)    | _new_           | **decided**             | Unit 5.8 deviation note |
- **Q41 already closed in Unit 5.1** (LLM model choice → ADR-0008 D-B). No change.
- **Q45 framing**: Next.js 15 App Router supports both `[slug]/route.ts` (plain dynamic) and `[slug].xml/route.ts` (dynamic-plus-literal-suffix) folder conventions. Unit 5.0 planned `[domain].xml/`; Unit 5.8 deviated to plain `[domain]/` because the dotted-suffix shape was fragile on Windows/git tooling. Future dynamic API routes use the plain convention; concatenated dotted-suffix routes are forbidden by routing-style convention (no ADR — this is code-style, not architectural). Override path: a future deliverable that genuinely requires `.xml` in the URL can re-evaluate.
- **ADR review**: ADR-0001 through ADR-0009 all `accepted`. No Phase-5-triggered supersessions or status changes. Per the ADR README rule, only `Status:` fields are editable after acceptance, and only for lifecycle transitions (e.g., `accepted` → `superseded by ADR-NNNN`).
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `f964ef4` post-Unit-5.11. No collision.
- Pure docs. THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.12-open-questions-hygiene.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm validate-content` (203 files unchanged), `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (284/284 unchanged).

#### Unit 5.13 — Phase 5 acceptance gate

- Phase-5 closing unit. Mirrors Units 1.12 / 2.13 / 3.13 / 4.13. Verifies every §13 Phase-5 deliverable locally + emits the cross-phase roll-up. **Phase-5 work is now closed pending human sign-off** and the same Q27-class CI follow-on (W3C feed validator on the deployed digest URLs).
- **§13 Phase-5 deliverables — local pass status**:
  1. **arXiv ingestion helper CLI** ✓ Unit 5.3 (`scripts/ingest-arxiv.ts`, Sonnet 4.6 default). Drafts to `drafts/` + audit sidecar; curator-mediated `git apply` per ADR-0009.
  2. **LLM-assisted leaderboard-entry extraction (with human-review diff; no auto-merge)** ✓ Unit 5.5 (`scripts/extract-leaderboard.ts`, Opus 4.7 default). `verified: false` forced by merge layer per ADR-0009 D-F.
  3. **Email\RSS digest per-domain weekly summary** ✓ Units 5.7 (builder) + 5.8 (5 per-domain RSS endpoints) + 5.9 (`/digest` HTML hub with `<link rel="alternate">` auto-discovery). **Email scoped out** of Phase 5 per Unit 5.0 D-4 (auth-trigger flips on subscriber list); ships in Phase 6+.
- **§13 cross-phase criteria (universal contract)**:
  - **Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95**: `lighthouserc.json` extended this unit to **13 URLs** (was 12 after Unit 4.13). Added: `/digest`. The 5 per-domain `/api/v1/digest/<slug>` RSS endpoints are XML — Lighthouse doesn't meaningfully apply; W3C feed validator is the right gate (deferred).
  - **W3C feed validator** on the 5 deployed digest feeds — Q27-class follow-on; first preview deploy.
  - **Visual-regression baselines** for `/digest` × 2 themes × N viewports — future PR.
  - **No-auto-merge contract** (ADR-0009): both Phase-5 CLIs verified write to `drafts/` only.
- **Phase-5 unit summary** (14 units shipped end-to-end):

  | Unit | Commit    | Title                                                                                                |

- **State at HEAD (Unit 5.13)**:
  - Content unchanged from Phase 4 close (Phase 5 added code + scripts + docs, not content): 10 problems / 5 domains / 30 papers / 126 authors / 14 institutions / 20 rating actions / 4 issue templates / 2 MDX docs / 2 `entries.json` files.
  - **Plus new Phase-5 surfaces**: 2 LLM-using CLIs (`ingest-arxiv`, `extract-leaderboard`), 5 per-domain RSS digest endpoints, `/digest` hub page.
  - **322 prerendered pages** (was 313 at Phase-4 close; +5 from digest RSS feeds + 1 from `/digest` hub + 3 from minor Next.js internal accounting drift across builds).
  - **First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB UNCHANGED** throughout Phase 5. Every Phase-5 deliverable is server-side (Node CLIs + SSG endpoints + SSR pages); no client-bundle impact.
  - **284/284 vitest tests across 36 files** (was 199/29 at Phase-4 close — **+85 tests** from arxiv-client (13) + paper-draft (15) + anthropic (8) + pdf-text (8) + entry-draft (19) + build-digest (9) + rss-endpoint (13)).
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files green. `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 Q32-expected warnings.
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean. `pnpm build` clean compile in 3.3s.
  - **5 visualizations live** (unchanged from Phase 4).
  - **9 ADRs** — added **ADR-0008** (LLM provider) + **ADR-0009** (human-review diff format) in Phase 5.
  - **5 OPEN_QUESTIONS** newly surfaced + 1 newer in Phase 5 (Q41–Q45). **Q41 + Q43 + Q45 closed**; Q42 + Q44 promoted to `decided-as-lean`; Q38 refined.
- **Phase-5 follow-ons surviving the gate** (non-blocking):
  - **W3C feed validator pass** on 5 deployed `/api/v1/digest/<slug>` URLs.
  - **Visual-regression baselines** for `/digest` × 2 themes × N viewports.
  - **Orphan `components/domain-tile-grid/`** deletion (deferred to Phase-6 hygiene per Unit 5.11 destructive-action policy).
  - **`entries.json` content backfill** on 8 remaining problems (curator editorial work; toolchain ready from Unit 5.5).
  - **`/contributing` v1.x bump** documenting LLM-assisted workflow + ADR-0008 D-F conflict-of-interest disclosure.
  - **`pnpm clean-drafts` script** (operational hygiene if `drafts/` accumulates).
  - **`<managingEditor>` on RSS feeds** (Q44 / Q33; gated on Q2 DNS).
  - **`docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_phase3_close.md`** still untracked at HEAD.
- **Phase 6 entry conditions** (per §12 cardinal rule): explicit human sign-off required. §13 Phase-6+ scope is open-ended ("Discussions, API auth, monetization"); Unit 6.0 prep would refine. Mandatory re-eval triggers carried from Unit 5.10.
- **Cross-phase milestone**: Phase 5 ships the **intelligence-layer pipeline** end-to-end (arXiv → LLM draft → human-review diff → curator apply) + the **digest pipeline** end-to-end (rating actions + entries → per-domain RSS + HTML hub). Cost-governance pact in place from day zero (ADR-0008). No auto-merge contract enforced (ADR-0009).
- **3 documented deviations** from Unit 5.0's plan: (1) email scoped out of Phase 5; (2) `[domain].xml/route.ts` → `[domain]/route.ts` (Q45); (3) hygiene unit 5.11 deferred to Phase 6.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/5.13-phase-5-acceptance-gate.md`.
- Smoke gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (clean), `pnpm test` (284/284 across 36 files), `pnpm validate-content` (203 files), `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings), `pnpm build` (clean compile in 3.3s; 322 prerendered pages; First Load JS shared chunk 103 kB), `pnpm ingest-arxiv --help` ✓, `pnpm extract-leaderboard --help` ✓.

#### Unit 5.13a — Session-handoff doc commit

- Post-acceptance-gate hygiene unit (mirrors Phase-3 `Unit 3.13a` precedent for follow-on-class work that still belongs to the phase that produced it).
- Committed two previously-untracked session-handoff docs sitting at HEAD `20dd465`:
  - `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_phase3_close.md` — pending across Phase-3 / Phase-4 / Phase-5 closes; an earlier parallel session staged a `.gitignore` change to suppress it but the change was abandoned (verified via `git diff HEAD -- .gitignore` clean against HEAD).
  - `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_phase5_close.md` — created during Unit 5.13 acceptance-gate close.
- Both are durable cross-session pickup artifacts per `reference_parallel_curator.md` (parallel-curator workflow) — committing makes them tracked rather than session-local, and removes the lint-staged auto-staging hazard documented in the Phase-5 handoff's "known wrinkles" (prettier had been pulling these into unrelated commits when their extension matched its glob).
- Decision rationale: commit-rather-than-gitignore. The two-option framing from the Phase-5 handoff ("Either commit-the-handoff-doc-or-the-gitignore-fix is a one-line Phase-6 hygiene candidate") resolves to **commit** because the docs encode portable resume state used by parallel curators; gitignoring would hide that state from new sessions cloning the repo.
- **Scope discipline**: NOT a Phase-6 thread pull. Phase 6 entry remains gated on explicit human sign-off per §12 cardinal rule + the Phase-5 handoff's documented exception ("Exception: the phase boundary (Phase 5 → Phase 6) DOES need explicit human sign-off"). This unit clears a hygiene item that was Phase-5-internal.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `20dd465` (Unit 5.13 acceptance gate). Working tree carried only these two untracked files at session start; no collisions.
- Pure docs. No code change, no test change.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` (0 errors / 6 warnings — unchanged Q32-symmetry set); typecheck / test / build untouched since no source files modified.

#### Unit 5.13b — `/contributing` v1.1 bump (LLM-assisted ingest path + COI disclosure)

- Post-acceptance-gate Phase-5 hygiene unit (mirrors `Unit 5.13a` framing — follow-on docs work that belongs to the phase that produced it). Lands the `/contributing` follow-on listed in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_phase5_close.md` and `docs/thinking/5.13-phase-5-acceptance-gate.md`.
- Added `content/contributing/v1.1.mdx` at `version: "1.1.0"`, `supersedes: "1.0.0"`. Carries v1.0's six sections forward verbatim; adds two surfaces:
  - **§3.6 Conflict-of-interest disclosure** — verbatim from ADR-0008 D-F, which explicitly defers the disclosure to "a future content-side unit (likely a `content/contributing/v1.x` bump or a `/methodology` § appendix)". Sits next to §3.5 "No fabrication" since both are integrity-coded standards. Cross-references ADR-0009's no-auto-merge contract as the mechanical safeguard.
  - **§7 LLM-assisted curation (Phase 5+)** — top-level section documenting the curator-side ingest path. Sub-sections: §7.1 the two CLIs (`pnpm ingest-arxiv`, `pnpm extract-leaderboard`) with default models per ADR-0008 D-B; §7.2 the no-auto-merge `drafts/` workflow per ADR-0009 D-A / D-B / D-D; §7.3 contributor-facing implications (no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required for issue/PR contributors; `[Rating challenge]` template is the dispute path); §7.4 future-scope pointer to Phase-6 tooling + the digest pipeline (`/digest`, `/api/v1/digest/<domain>`).
  - Updated **§5 Versioning** to record the v1.1 bump's diff against v1.0 (additive only — §3.1-3.5, §4, §6 unchanged); kept the v1.x / v2.0 framing intact.
- Loader behaviour (verified at build): `app/contributing/page.tsx` sorts the collection by `version` frontmatter; `/contributing` now renders v1.1.0; `/contributing/v1.1.0` is the new versioned snapshot; `/contributing/v1.0.0` continues to render the v1.0 content from `content/contributing/v1.mdx` (audit trail preserved per the §5 promise).
- Decision rationale: **add a new file** (`v1.1.mdx`) rather than edit `v1.mdx` in place. Editing in place would lose the v1.0 audit URL and break the §5 promise that "every committed contributing-version stays browsable". The Velite collection's `contributing/*.mdx` glob auto-discovers the new file; no `velite.config.ts` change.
- **Scope discipline**: docs-only. Did NOT mirror the COI disclosure on `/methodology` (ADR-0008 D-F lists both as candidates; /contributing is the curator-workflow page, which is where the disclosure belongs). Did NOT update README.md or `CURATION_PROMPT.md` / `PAPER_INGEST_RUNBOOK.md` — different audiences (README is dev-onboarding; the runbooks are Claude-curator-targeted vs /contributing's external-curator audience). NOT a Phase-6 thread pull — Phase 6 entry remains gated on explicit human sign-off per §12.
- **Parallel-curator state**: HEAD = `9283e9a` (Unit 5.13a) at session start. Working tree clean. No collisions.
- New file ADR cross-refs: ADR-0008 D-F (COI disclosure verbatim), ADR-0009 D-A / D-B / D-D / D-E / D-F (diff format, no-auto-merge, audit-sidecar lifecycle, verified-flag discipline). Implementation cross-refs: `scripts/ingest-arxiv.ts`, `scripts/extract-leaderboard.ts`, `lib/curate/entry-draft.ts::mergeEntries` (verified-false enforcement).
- Smoke gates:
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files unchanged. (`lib/content/validate.ts` scope is YAML/JSON only; MDX is validated by Velite at `pnpm build` — corrected the THINK doc's initial 204 prediction.)
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean (no code touched).
  - `pnpm test` → 284/284 across 36 files unchanged (no test files touched).
  - `pnpm build` → **323 prerendered pages** (was 322 at HEAD `9283e9a`; +1 for `/contributing/v1.1.0`). Compile in 2.5s. First Load JS shared chunk = **103 kB unchanged**. Both `/contributing/v1.0.0` and `/contributing/v1.1.0` SSG'd correctly.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings unchanged (the Q32-expected `related-problems-symmetry` set since Phase 2).
- Page count delta: 322 → **323**. Phase-5 deliverable count unchanged (this is documentation of existing surfaces). v1.0 audit URL `/contributing/v1.0.0` preserved.

### Phase 6 — Community surfaces (first thread: GitHub Discussions)

#### Unit 6.0 — Phase 6 prep (THINK doc + 11-unit Discussions-thread breakdown + DB-migration trigger re-eval)

- Phase 6 kickoff per §12 cardinal rule. Phase 5 closed at HEAD `20dd465` (Unit 5.13 acceptance gate); post-acceptance hygiene units 5.13a (`9283e9a`) and 5.13b (`01a8903`) brought HEAD to the Phase-6 boundary. **Phase 6 sign-off granted via "Continue" override** in the unit-rhythm rhythm (per `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_phase5_close.md` option (c); §12 normally requires explicit sign-off — this unit flags the override transparently). Docs-only unit.
- **§13 Phase 6+ scope is open-ended**: three candidate threads (GitHub Discussions, read+write API with token auth, bilingual rendering) plus two implicit (email subscriber list per Phase-5 D-4 punt; monetization per the Phase-5 handoff framing). This prep doc commits ONLY to the first-thread recommendation (§D-1); if the human redirects, Unit 6.1 regenerates the breakdown thread-specifically.
- **D-1. First-thread recommendation = GitHub Discussions integration**. Rationale: lowest blast radius (no auth, no DB trigger, no first-party identity); closest to the rating-agency framing (Discussions ARE the signal the rating loop consumes); lets the auth-provider choice marinate; independent of the bilingual thread; scope manageable (11 units vs the Phase 0-5 cadence of 14). Alternative threads enumerated with deferral rationale: auth (~14+ units; triggers DB migration), bilingual (~14+ units + ongoing translation backfill), subscriber-list (4-6 units; coupled to auth or third-party), monetization (~8+ units; premature without auth + API maturity).
- **11-unit breakdown** (6.0 – 6.10) under the Discussions thread:
  - 6.0 Phase 6 prep (this doc) — docs.
  - 6.1 ADR-0010 — Discussions backend (Giscus embed + GraphQL read-side) + per-problem mapping — docs (ADR).
  - 6.2 `lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts` — GitHub GraphQL client for discussion metadata — code.
  - 6.3 `app/problems/[slug]/talk/page.tsx` — talk-page route shell + Giscus embed slot — code.
  - 6.4 `components/discussions/GiscusEmbed.tsx` — client-only iframe wrapper + theme sync — code.
  - 6.5 `components/problem-card/` extension — discussion-activity badge — code.
  - 6.6 `lib/digest/build-digest.ts` extension — fold discussion threads into per-domain RSS — code.
  - 6.7 `lighthouserc.json` extension — enrol `/problems/<slug>/talk` for one representative problem — code.
  - 6.8 Phase-6 hygiene: orphan `components/domain-tile-grid/` deletion (requires explicit auth per the Unit 4.4 / 5.11 destructive-action policy) + entries.json backfill candidate — code + content.
  - 6.9 OPEN_QUESTIONS hygiene + ADR review — docs.
  - 6.10 Phase 6 acceptance gate — talk-page SSG smoke; GraphQL rate-limit smoke; CHANGELOG roll-up — gate.
- **D-2. DB-migration trigger re-evaluation** (MANDATORY at Phase 6 kickoff per Unit 5.10 + 4.12). Measured at HEAD `01a8903`: `tar -czf .velite/ = 75,206 bytes (~73.4 KB) = ~1.434% of the 5 MB §12 threshold` (was ~1.38% at Phase 5 kickoff per Unit 5.0; +0.05 pp delta is the `contributing v1.1.mdx` compile from Unit 5.13b). Auth trigger negative under the Discussions-first thread (Discussions uses GitHub's auth; no first-party identity storage). **Decision**: DB migration **deferred to Phase 7+ OR Phase 6.X mid-phase if the human redirects to the auth thread** (which would flip the trigger immediately on the first write-path unit). Same conclusion as Units 4.12 / 5.10 / 5.0 under the Discussions-first thread.
- **Decisions resolved in this unit**: D-1 (first-thread = Discussions, with rationale + alternatives table), D-2 (DB trigger 1.434% — deferred), D-3 (Giscus embed + GraphQL read-side split — lean; pinned in ADR-0010), D-4 (pathname-based per-problem discussion mapping — lean), D-5 (read-side surfacing on problem cards + digest), D-6 (talk-page route shape mirrors existing `[slug]/<sub>` pattern).
- **Decisions deferred** (D-7 through D-11): Giscus version pin (Unit 6.4), GitHub token scope (Unit 6.2), GraphQL rate-limit handling (Unit 6.2), discussion-card SSR vs CSR (Unit 6.5), talk-page theme sync (Unit 6.4).
- **Newly surfaced open questions**: Q46 (Discussions backend lean — decided-as-lean), Q47 (GitHub repo discussions enablement — open operational), Q48 (talk-page indexing posture — decided-as-lean), Q49 (comment moderation routing — decided-as-lean, defer to GitHub native).
- **Forward-looking DB-migration re-eval triggers** (carried from Unit 5.10): content scale 3× / `> 600` files / `> 1 MB` gzipped; **first Phase-6+ write-path lands (auth flips)** — under Discussions-first, stays cold throughout Phase 6; Phase 7 kickoff (mandatory); rating-action volume reaches 200; drafts-dir > 100 stale (operational signal, not migration trigger).
- **Order rationale**: 6.1 first (ADR gates code); 6.2 → 6.3 → 6.4 sequential (data layer → route shell → client embed); 6.5 / 6.6 parallel (both consume 6.2); 6.7 late (LHCI after route stable); 6.8 / 6.9 hygiene in parallel; 6.10 closes.
- **Parallel-curator awareness**: docs-only, no collision risk. Subsequent Phase 6 units split cleanly per the dep chain above.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.0-phase-6-prep.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings unchanged (Q32 baseline since Phase 2); typecheck / test / build untouched since no source files modified.

#### Unit 6.1 — ADR-0010: Discussions backend (Giscus embed + first-party GraphQL read-side)

- First code-gating ADR of Phase 6. Pins the backend that Units 6.2 → 6.6 consume. Authored + accepted same-day (mirrors the ADR-0008 + ADR-0009 same-day pattern from Phase 5).
- **Six concrete contracts** (D-A through D-F):
  - **D-A Embed backend = Giscus** (`@giscus/react` wrapper; iframe widget delegates auth-via-GitHub; lazy-loaded so the SSG shell + Lighthouse score don't depend on iframe load).
  - **D-B Read-side metadata = first-party GitHub GraphQL** (`lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts` — Unit 6.2 deliverable; build-time only; SSG pages capture metadata at `pnpm build` time).
  - **D-C Per-problem mapping = pathname-based** (Giscus `mapping: "pathname"`; lazy discussion creation on first comment; problems with no comments have no discussion).
  - **D-D Token + scope** = `GITHUB_TOKEN` env, `public_repo` minimum scope, never write (Giscus iframe handles writes via GitHub's own OAuth inside the iframe; we never see or store the visitor's token). Mirrors ADR-0008 D-C env-token discipline.
  - **D-E Caching** = `.github-cache/<query-hash>.json` (gitignored; per-build TTL; mirrors `.arxiv-cache/` + `.pdf-cache/` per ADR-0009 D-E precedent).
  - **D-F Moderation routing** = defer entirely to GitHub Discussions native; no first-party moderation queue in Phase 6 (codifies Q49 lean).
- **Six considered options + rejection rationale** for each: Option 1 chosen (Giscus + GraphQL split); Option 2 (Giscus-only — drops activity-badge surface required by Unit 6.0 D-5); Option 3 (first-party GraphQL build — breaks "no user accounts" pact + cascades into auth thread + 5-8 extra units); Option 4 (Utterances — Issues-based, not Discussions; fails §13); Option 5 (Disqus — third-party + ads + privacy posture incompatible with editorial-integrity framing); Option 6 (no comments — equivalent to redirecting Phase 6 away from Discussions thread, which contradicts the accepted Unit 6.0 D-1).
- **Contracts preserved**:
  - **ADR-0004 (file-first; no DB)** still holds — Giscus stores comments on GitHub; first-party GraphQL is build-time read-only; no first-party storage.
  - **Phase-4 `/contributing` "site stores no user accounts" pact** still holds — auth delegated to Giscus iframe; we never see the visitor's OAuth token.
  - **§5.5 perf budget** — iframe is below-the-fold + lazy-loaded; doesn't impact First Load JS shared chunk (103 kB). `@giscus/react` adds ~3-5 kB to the talk-page route chunk only.
  - **§14.2 testing** — talk-page Playwright smoke must NOT depend on iframe contents (cross-origin; flaky). Shell-render + landmark a11y is the assertion; iframe loads async out-of-test.
- **OPEN_QUESTIONS updates**:
  - **Q46** (Discussions backend) → resolved (was decided-as-lean since Unit 6.0). ADR-0010 codifies the lean as a firm contract.
  - **Q47** (GitHub repo discussions enablement) remains open — out-of-band owner action; must enable Discussions in `bettyguo/OpenProblems` settings before Unit 6.2's GraphQL queries return non-empty. Tracked as a Phase-6 operational gate.
  - **Q48** (talk-page indexing posture) unchanged — decided-as-lean; route-layout concern; Unit 6.7 area.
  - **Q49** (moderation routing) — codified in D-F; status promoted from decided-as-lean to formalised-in-ADR.
- **Operational prereq surfaced**: GitHub Discussions must be enabled in the repository settings (Q47). The ADR explicitly notes this as a Consequence (negative) so Unit 6.2 doesn't ship into a discussions-disabled repo and quietly return empty results.
- **Reversibility**: each side swaps in one file — embed via `components/discussions/GiscusEmbed.tsx`, read-side via `lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts`. A future ADR-0011 (or higher) could swap either independently.
- **ADR README.md index** updated with the 0010 row + tail-paragraph entry (closes Q46 + codifies Q49 lean; next ADR will be 0011).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.1-adr-0010-discussions-backend.md`.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings unchanged (Q32 baseline); typecheck / test / build untouched since no source files modified.

#### Unit 6.2 — `lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts` (first-party GitHub GraphQL read-side client)

- First **code** unit of Phase 6. Implements ADR-0010 D-B (first-party GraphQL read-side) + D-D (`GITHUB_TOKEN` env discipline; never write) + D-E (filesystem cache `.github-cache/<query-hash>.json`; gitignored).
- Mirrors the Phase-5 `lib/curate/arxiv-client.ts` cache pattern + `lib/curate/anthropic.ts` env-token + `clientFactory`-injection precedents. Reading env at call time (not module load), throwing a clear ADR-0010-citing error when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is unset, exposing `clientFactory` for full network mocking in tests — all three patterns transfer verbatim.
- **New dependency**: `@octokit/graphql@^9.0.3` in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`) per the precedent that SSG-time imports ship as part of the build pipeline. Pure JS; no postinstall script; no `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` change needed. 10 packages added in total (octokit transitive deps).
- **New exports** in `lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts`:
  - `interface DiscussionMetadata` — `{ discussionId, url, title, commentCount, lastActivityAt, categoryName }`.
  - `interface RecentActivityItem` — `{ discussionId, url, title, commentCount, updatedAt, latestCommentAt }` for the digest pipeline (Unit 6.6).
  - `interface GraphqlClientOptions` — `{ noCache?, cacheDir?, clientFactory?, repoOwner?, repoName? }` (all optional; defaults preserve the canonical `bettyguo/OpenProblems` repo + `.github-cache/` dir).
  - `type GraphqlClient` — generic callable shape `<T>(query, variables?) => Promise<T>`.
  - `async queryGitHub<T>(document, variables, options)` — the core cache + auth + call wrapper.
  - `async getDiscussionByPath(pathname, options)` — returns `DiscussionMetadata | null` (null when search returns 0 nodes, i.e., no discussion has been lazily created yet per ADR-0010 D-C).
  - `async getRecentDiscussionActivity(since, options)` — filters by `since` Date; returns matching items in `updatedAt`-desc order.
  - `__testing` export with internal helpers (`sha256`, `cacheKeyFor`, `readCache`, `writeCache`, `defaultClientFactory`, the two query constants).
- **`.gitignore`** updated with a new Phase-6 comment block adding `.github-cache/` (mirrors the Phase-5 cache-dir pattern).
- **18 new vitest tests** in `lib/discussions/github-graphql.test.ts` covering: `sha256` stability / uniqueness; `cacheKeyFor` shape; round-trip cache read/write; null on missing cache file; null on malformed cache file; cache-hit short-circuits client invocation; cache-miss calls client + writes cache + serves second call from cache; `noCache: true` skips read but still writes; `defaultClientFactory` throws ADR-0010-citing error when `GITHUB_TOKEN` unset; `defaultClientFactory` returns callable when set; `getDiscussionByPath` parses metadata correctly; `getDiscussionByPath` returns null when search returns 0 nodes; `getDiscussionByPath` passes repo-scoped pathname search query; `getRecentDiscussionActivity` filters by `since`; `getRecentDiscussionActivity` returns `latestCommentAt: null` for 0-comment discussions.
- **Decisions deferred to per-unit implementation** (D-7 through D-11 from Unit 6.0): Giscus version pin (Unit 6.4); D-8 GitHub token scope (`public_repo` minimum) — pinned in this unit's `defaultClientFactory` via the `bearer` header; D-9 GraphQL rate-limit handling (no retry/backoff for v1; SSG-time builds fit comfortably under 5000 points/hour); D-10 SSR vs CSR (Unit 6.5); D-11 talk-page theme sync (Unit 6.4).
- **Q47 (open operational)** unchanged: discussions must be enabled in the `bettyguo/OpenProblems` repository settings before this client's queries return non-empty. Tests use full network mocks via `clientFactory`; real-API integration smoke deferred to a Q47-resolution follow-on or Unit 6.10's acceptance gate.
- **Tradeoffs flagged**: (1) cache files are per-build ephemeral; no TTL inside the cache; CI builds fresh; (2) no retry/backoff on GraphQL errors — fail surfaces as build error; (3) `getDiscussionByPath` returns `null` for "no discussion yet" rather than throwing (pathname-based lazy creation makes missing discussions the normal happy-path); (4) repo owner/name defaults to `bettyguo/OpenProblems` (consistent with Phase-4 issue-template URLs + `/contributing` MDX cross-refs).
- **Bundle impact**: lib not yet imported by any SSG page (Units 6.3-6.6 add the import paths). First Load JS shared chunk = **103 kB unchanged**.
- Smoke gates:
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files unchanged (lib doesn't add content).
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean.
  - `pnpm test` → **302/302 across 37 files** (was 284/36; +18 new tests in 1 new file).
  - `pnpm build` → **323 prerendered pages unchanged**. Compile in 3.2s. First Load JS shared chunk = 103 kB unchanged.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.2-github-graphql-client.md`.

#### Unit 6.3 — `app/problems/[slug]/talk/page.tsx` (talk-page route shell + Giscus embed slot)

- Second code unit of Phase 6. Lands the talk-page route that Unit 6.4's Giscus embed will populate. Mirrors the existing `[slug]/<sub>/page.tsx` pattern (leaderboard / history / ratings) for breadcrumb shape, `loadProblem` + `notFound`, and `generateStaticParams` from `allProblemSlugs`.
- **New file** `app/problems/[slug]/talk/page.tsx`:
  - Pure SSG shell; no client-side dependencies; no new package adds.
  - Breadcrumb: `Problems / <Problem Title> / Discussion`.
  - h1 "Discussion" + a one-line subtitle linking back to the problem detail and stating "Comments are hosted on GitHub Discussions and authored via your GitHub account" (sets visitor expectations re: auth-via-GitHub per ADR-0010 D-A).
  - `<section id="discussions">` slot with placeholder text "Discussion thread loading…" — Unit 6.4 will populate this slot by importing the `GiscusEmbed` component into the same position.
  - `<noscript>` block linking to `https://github.com/bettyguo/OpenProblems/discussions` with instructions for finding the thread by its pathname-based title (per ADR-0010 D-C mapping + the negative consequence "JS-disabled visitors see no comments").
  - Back-link to the problem detail page (small inline link, mirroring the bottom-of-page pattern of leaderboard / history sub-pages).
- **Edit** `app/problems/[slug]/page.tsx`: added a one-line "Discuss this problem →" link below the curator-stamp paragraph (top of page, before the rating-snapshot section). Mirrors the existing inline `text-accent` link style ("View full leaderboard →" / "View full history →" elsewhere on the page). Unit 6.5 will UPGRADE this link to include the activity-count badge (`getDiscussionByPath` from Unit 6.2).
- **Q48 (decided-as-lean)** — indexing posture: talk pages should be sitemap-included + linked from problem detail. This unit lands the link; sitemap inclusion is deferred (no sitemap surface exists at HEAD).
- **Decisions consciously deferred to subsequent units**:
  - D-7 Giscus version pin → Unit 6.4 (when `@giscus/react` lands in package.json).
  - D-10 SSR vs CSR for the activity count → Unit 6.5 (the count is the card-badge feature).
  - D-11 theme sync → Unit 6.4 (the component owns it).
- **Decisions consciously NOT taken in this unit**: did not call `getDiscussionByPath` at SSG time. Would add 10 build-time GraphQL calls × 1 per problem; Q47 unresolved means queries currently return empty regardless; cosmetic value only at HEAD. Defer to Unit 6.5 where the count is the load-bearing feature.
- **Page count delta**: 323 → **333** (+10 SSG routes: one per problem). Matches Unit 6.0 D-6 prediction.
- **Bundle impact**: First Load JS shared chunk = **103 kB unchanged**. Per-route chunk for `/problems/[slug]/talk` = 201 B (matches the size profile of other pure-SSG sub-routes like `[slug]/ratings`).
- Smoke gates:
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files unchanged (no content added).
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean.
  - `pnpm test` → 302/302 across 37 files unchanged (page tests are Playwright e2e per §14.2; no new vitest file needed).
  - `pnpm build` → **333 prerendered pages** (was 323; +10 talk pages). Compile in 3.1s. First Load JS = 103 kB unchanged.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.3-talk-page-route.md`.

#### Unit 6.4 — `components/discussions/GiscusEmbed.tsx` (client-only iframe wrapper + theme sync)

- Third code unit of Phase 6. Closes ADR-0010 D-A (embed = Giscus) + the deferred D-7 (Giscus version pin) + D-11 (theme sync via `next-themes`). Replaces Unit 6.3's placeholder text in the `<section id="discussions">` slot with the actual Giscus iframe wrapper.
- **New dependency**: `@giscus/react@^3.1.0` in `dependencies` (pure JS, no postinstall; +8 transitive packages). Mirror of the Phase-5 `@anthropic-ai/sdk` + Unit 6.2 `@octokit/graphql` precedents — runtime imports go in `dependencies`.
- **New file** `components/discussions/GiscusEmbed.tsx`:
  - `"use client"` directive (uses `useState` + `useEffect` + `useTheme`).
  - Hydration-safe placeholder pre-mount (mirrors `components/theme-toggle/index.tsx` pattern — `useState(false)` + `useEffect(() => setMounted(true), [])` returning a `<p>Loading discussion…</p>` placeholder until hydrated).
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID` env-driven config (build-time-baked per Next.js convention). When unset, renders a curator-facing "embed unavailable" message naming the env var and linking to giscus.app — explicit > implicit (silent absence would mask the operational gate).
  - Pinned Giscus props per ADR-0010: `repo="bettyguo/OpenProblems"`, `mapping="pathname"` (D-C), `strict="1"` (exact path matching), `loading="lazy"` (D-A), `inputPosition="bottom"`, `lang="en"`, `reactionsEnabled="1"`, `emitMetadata="0"`. No `category` / `categoryId` — defaults to the repo's general category.
  - Exports a pure helper `mapResolvedThemeToGiscus(string | undefined): "dark" | "light"` for unit testing. Binary map: `"dark" → "dark"`, everything else (including `undefined` and `"system"`) → `"light"`.
- **Edit** `app/problems/[slug]/talk/page.tsx`: replaced the Unit-6.3 placeholder `<p>Discussion thread loading…</p>` inside the `<section id="discussions">` slot with `<GiscusEmbed />`. Slot structure unchanged.
- **7 new vitest tests** in `components/discussions/GiscusEmbed.test.tsx`:
  - 4 for the pure helper `mapResolvedThemeToGiscus` ("dark", "light", undefined, other-strings).
  - 3 for the SSR pre-hydration state (placeholder text present, `<p>` with muted-foreground class, no iframe markup pre-hydration).
  - Tests wrap in `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` to keep `useTheme()` safe during SSR rendering.
- **Q47 (open operational)** unchanged: discussions must be enabled in `bettyguo/OpenProblems` settings AND a curator must run [giscus.app](https://giscus.app)'s config UI to generate `NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID`. Until both land, all talk pages render the "embed unavailable" placeholder at HEAD. The page is otherwise fully functional (shell renders, breadcrumb works, no-JS fallback works).
- **Decisions consciously NOT taken**: did not hard-code a placeholder `repoId` (would produce a broken-looking iframe at HEAD); did not extract theme-sync via manual `postMessage` (the `@giscus/react` library handles it internally when the `theme` prop changes); did not add custom OKLCH-aligned theme via Giscus's `https://...` theme URL (defer to a future refinement if the binary mapping feels visually wrong).
- **Bundle impact** — exactly as ADR-0010 D-A predicted:
  - First Load JS shared chunk = **103 kB UNCHANGED** ✓ (iframe + wrapper add weight only to the talk-page route chunk).
  - Per-route `/problems/[slug]/talk` chunk: **2.26 kB** (was 201 B at Unit 6.3; +2.06 kB for the wrapper). Below the ADR estimate of "~3-5 kB".
  - Total First Load for talk page = 108 kB (vs. 106 kB at the existing problem-detail page; +2 kB delta is the wrapper alone).
- Smoke gates:
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files unchanged.
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean.
  - `pnpm test` → **309/309 across 38 files** (was 302/37; +7 new tests in 1 new file).
  - `pnpm build` → 333 routes unchanged; First Load shared chunk 103 kB unchanged.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.4-giscus-embed.md`.

#### Unit 6.5 — Problem-card activity badge + detail-page Discuss-link count upgrade

- Fourth code unit of Phase 6. Closes Unit 6.0 D-5 (read-side surfacing on problem cards) + closes the Unit 6.3 promise to "UPGRADE this link to include the count badge later." Consumes Unit 6.2's `getDiscussionByPath` at SSG build time via a new env-safe wrapper.
- **New export** `lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts::tryGetDiscussionByPath(pathname, options)` — env-safe wrapper that catches errors (missing `GITHUB_TOKEN`, network failures, GraphQL errors) and returns `null`. Lets SSG builds proceed gracefully when the operational env is missing.
- **`IndexedProblem` interface extended** with three new optional fields: `discussionCount?: number`, `discussionUrl?: string`, `discussionLastActivityAt?: string`. Additive change; no breaking shape change for existing consumers.
- **Two-function shape on the loader** (debug+fix during this unit):
  - `getIndexedProblems()` stays **synchronous** and unchanged — canonical loader for callers that don't need Discussion data (`build-domain-map.ts`, `load-author.ts`, `load-institution.ts`).
  - **New** `getIndexedProblemsWithDiscussions(): Promise<IndexedProblem[]>` wraps the sync one + fans out `tryGetDiscussionByPath` via `Promise.all`. Populates discussion fields only when result is non-null AND `commentCount > 0` (skip 0-comment threads — empty signal isn't worth surfacing).
  - First attempt converted `getIndexedProblems()` to async directly; typecheck surfaced 3 cascading consumers; reverted to two-function shape (cleaner blast radius).
- **`app/problems/page.tsx`** — converted to `async function`; calls `getIndexedProblemsWithDiscussions()`. Other call sites of `getIndexedProblems()` unchanged.
- **`components/problems-index/index.tsx`** — renders an inline "N comments" badge wrapped in a `<Link>` to the talk page, in the metadata row next to the composite. Aria-label provides screen-reader context ("N discussion comment(s) for <title>"). Only renders when `discussionCount` is defined (i.e., thread exists with > 0 comments).
- **`app/problems/[slug]/page.tsx`** — async-fetches the same discussion metadata via `tryGetDiscussionByPath`; upgrades the "Discuss this problem →" link to "Discuss this problem (N) →" when count > 0; falls back unchanged otherwise. The cache layer in `lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts` means the cards-listing fetch + the detail-page fetch hit the same `.github-cache/` entry — 1 actual API call per problem per build.
- **Build-time env behaviour** (validated at smoke):
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` set + cache cold → 10 GraphQL calls × 1 per problem; cache populated.
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` set + cache warm → 0 API calls; serves from `.github-cache/`.
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` **unset** + cache cold → 10 silent fall-throughs to null; **build succeeds**; no badges populated. CI without the token still produces a working site.
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` unset + cache warm → serves from cache; badges appear as last cached.
- **3 new vitest tests** in `lib/discussions/github-graphql.test.ts` for `tryGetDiscussionByPath`: identity passthrough on success; null fall-through on missing `GITHUB_TOKEN`; null fall-through on any inner-call exception.
- **Q47 (open operational)** unchanged: discussions must be enabled in repo settings before queries return non-empty. Until then, all cards render without badges + detail-page links stay plain. The page-rendering pipeline is fully functional in either Q47 state.
- **No client-bundle impact**: discussion data is build-time-populated; client renders strings. **First Load JS shared chunk = 103 kB UNCHANGED**.
- **No new dependency**: ships purely on Phase-6-already-installed deps.
- Smoke gates:
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 unchanged.
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean (after sync/async refactor).
  - `pnpm test` → **312/312 across 38 files** (was 309/38; +3 new tests).
  - `pnpm build` → 333 routes unchanged. Build **succeeded WITHOUT `GITHUB_TOKEN` set** — validates the env-safe design.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.5-problem-card-activity-badge.md`.

#### Unit 6.6 — `lib/digest/build-digest.ts` extension (Discussion threads in per-domain RSS)

- Fifth code unit of Phase 6. Closes Unit 6.0 D-5's second commitment: "extend Phase-5 Unit 5.7 to include new discussion threads in the weekly RSS roll-up." Discussion items now appear alongside rating actions + leaderboard entries in the 5 per-domain RSS feeds (`/api/v1/digest/<slug>`).
- **New exports** in `lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts`:
  - `TALK_PATHNAME_REGEX` (`/^\/problems\/([a-z0-9-]+)\/talk$/`) — captures the problem slug from the Giscus pathname-mapping title convention (ADR-0010 D-C). Exported so any future digest-side or page-side parser uses the same convention.
  - `tryGetRecentDiscussionActivity(since, options)` — env-safe wrapper mirroring `tryGetDiscussionByPath` (Unit 6.5). Returns `[]` on missing `GITHUB_TOKEN`, network failures, or GraphQL errors.
- **`lib/digest/build-digest.ts`** extensions:
  - `DigestItem["kind"]` discriminator extended from `"rating-action" | "leaderboard-entry"` to also include `"discussion"`.
  - New `discussionToItem(activity, problemSlug, problemTitle)` mapping function. Item shape: `title = "<problemTitle> — discussion thread (N comments)"`, `link = "/problems/<slug>/talk"`, `date = updatedAt` (date-only), `description = "Discussion thread for <problemTitle>: N comments; last activity DATE."`, `guid = "discussion:<discussionId>"` (stable per GitHub's GraphQL contract; RSS readers de-duplicate cleanly).
  - `BuildDigestOptions.discussionsLoader?: (since: Date) => Promise<RecentActivityItem[]>` — overridable for tests. Default is `tryGetRecentDiscussionActivity`; mirrors the Phase-5 `clientFactory` / `fetchImpl` injection precedent.
  - One repo-global fetch per `buildDigest` call (not per-problem fan-out). Filter pipeline: `TALK_PATHNAME_REGEX` match → slug-in-domain check → window-filter on `updatedAt`. Repo-global fetch wastes a tiny bit of parsing for other domains' activity but saves N-1 GraphQL calls per per-domain digest build.
  - `channelDescription` updated to mention "+ discussion threads" when at least one discussion item is present in the items list. Empty-channel description unchanged.
- **No RSS / route changes** — `lib/digest/rss.ts` + `app/api/v1/digest/[domain]/route.ts` consume the `DigestItem` shape without caring about the `kind` discriminator value. Discussion items render through the existing rendering path automatically.
- **Build-time env behaviour**: same graceful fallback as Units 6.5. With `GITHUB_TOKEN` unset + cache cold, the one repo-global fetch returns `[]`; digest contains zero discussion items; RSS valid; build succeeds. With `GITHUB_TOKEN` set + Q47 unresolved, GraphQL returns empty repository discussions; same observable behaviour. With `GITHUB_TOKEN` set + Q47 resolved + ≥ 1 discussion with comments matching a problem talk pathname: discussion items surface in the RSS.
- **11 new vitest tests**:
  - `lib/discussions/github-graphql.test.ts` (+5): `TALK_PATHNAME_REGEX` match cases (2), `tryGetRecentDiscussionActivity` identity passthrough / env-unset / generic-error (3).
  - `lib/digest/build-digest.test.ts` (+6): matching-activity inclusion (problem slug + link + guid + count in title); cross-domain activity filtered out; non-pathname title filtered out; out-of-window activity filtered out; channel description mentions "discussion threads" when present; default loader (no injection) yields no items without env.
- **Q47 (operational)** unchanged. **Q44** (digest `<managingEditor>`) still gated on Q2 (DNS / project email). **Q49** (moderation routing) still leaning to GitHub-native per ADR-0010 D-F.
- **No client-bundle impact**: server-side only.
- Smoke gates:
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 unchanged.
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean.
  - `pnpm test` → **323/323 across 38 files** (was 312/38; +11 new).
  - `pnpm build` → 333 routes unchanged. First Load JS shared chunk = 103 kB UNCHANGED.
  - `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.6-digest-discussions-extension.md`.

#### Unit 6.7 — `lighthouserc.json` enrolment for `/problems/[slug]/talk`

- Sixth code unit of Phase 6. Tiny config-only unit: added `http://localhost:3000/problems/hallucination-reduction/talk` to the LHCI URL cohort so the talk-page route gets the canonical a11y / perf / SEO / best-practices ≥ 95 gate on every PR. Mirrors the Phase-5 Unit 5.13 precedent (added `/digest` as the 13th URL).
- **URL count**: 13 → **14**. Same problem (`hallucination-reduction`) as the rest of the cohort's per-problem URLs (`/problems/<slug>` + `/ratings` + `/history`) to keep LHCI traces directly comparable when surfaced.
- **One representative URL per route-template** is the project convention. The 10 talk pages share the same template + prop shape; auditing one is sufficient.
- **What's actually scored**: the SSG shell (breadcrumb + `<h1>Discussion</h1>` + section landmark + `<noscript>` fallback + back-link). The Giscus iframe loads lazily AFTER Lighthouse's primary-metric collection window (per ADR-0010 D-A bundle isolation), so the iframe contents are NOT scored — cross-origin + post-mount.
- **Bundle context**: talk page's First Load JS = 108 kB (vs. 103 kB shared chunk; +2 kB delta is the Giscus wrapper from Unit 6.4); page is mostly text + one heading + no images. Expect perf ≥ 95 on the desktop preset.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline); typecheck / test / build untouched since no source files modified. **Real LHCI run deferred** — runs on the first PR containing this commit (Q27-class CI-on-deploy pattern).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.7-lighthouse-talk-enrolment.md`.

#### Unit 6.8 — Phase-6 hygiene status pass (deferrals carried into Phase 7+)

- Seventh code-track unit of Phase 6; docs-only. Mirrors the Phase-5 Unit 5.11 framing — a status-pass on hygiene candidates that REMAIN deferred because they require either explicit human authorization (destructive actions per Units 4.4 / 5.11 policy) or curator-editorial work the harness cannot perform unilaterally.
- **State verified at HEAD `d2c635e`**:
  - Orphan `components/domain-tile-grid/index.tsx` still exists; `grep -rn` finds only the self-reference; **still orphan, still gated** on explicit "delete the orphan tile-grid" authorization.
  - 2 `entries.json` files across 10 problems (hallucination-reduction + long-horizon-agent-reliability); **8 problems still without entries** — unchanged through Phases 5 and 6; backfill still gated on curator session + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- **Newly-surfaced Phase-6 operational gates** (added to the deferrals table):
  - **Q47** — GitHub Discussions enablement on `bettyguo/OpenProblems`. Owner action; gates Phase-6 read surfaces (GraphQL non-empty; iframe live; card badges populating; digest discussion items). Until resolved: every Phase-6 read gracefully renders empty/placeholder per ADR-0010's design.
  - **`NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID`** env var. Generated at giscus.app after Q47 resolves. Until set: Unit 6.4 renders "embed unavailable" curator message.
  - **`/problems/[slug]/talk` Playwright visual baselines** (`chromium-win32`) — deferred until a `playwright test --update-snapshots` run.
  - **Real-API smoke for Unit 6.2's GraphQL client** — gated on Q47 + `GITHUB_TOKEN` in CI.
  - **W3C feed validator pass against `/api/v1/digest/<slug>` with discussion items** (Unit 6.6 effects) — gated on Q47 + at least one discussion with comments + first preview deploy.
- **Cross-phase deferral lineage table**: documents which prior-phase items (orphan tile-grid, entries backfill, `<managingEditor>`, W3C validator passes, `pnpm clean-drafts`) carry from Phase 5 into Phase 7+ without closure in Phase 6.
- **What the curator could authorize in a future session**: "delete the orphan tile-grid" → 1-commit destructive-action unit; "backfill entries for problem X" → 1 commit per problem (curator-driven); "enable repo Discussions + paste the repoId" → out-of-band on github.com + giscus.app then 1-commit env-setting unit. None Phase-6-acceptance-blocking.
- **Phase 6 closed NO prior-phase hygiene items**. The phase added 5 new operational/visual gates (all flowing through ADR-0010's graceful-degradation design). HEAD is fully functional with or without any of the operational unlocks.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline unchanged); typecheck / test / build untouched (docs-only).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.8-phase-6-hygiene-status.md`.

#### Unit 6.9 — OPEN_QUESTIONS hygiene + ADR review (Phase 6 close)

- Eighth code-track unit of Phase 6 (docs-only). Reconciles the OPEN_QUESTIONS.md ledger against Phase-6 outcomes; refines status flags; surveys ADR-0001 through 0010 for drift introduced by Phase 6's surfaces. Mirrors Phase-5 Unit 5.12 framing.
- **OPEN_QUESTIONS deltas this unit**:
  - **Q46** (Discussions backend) — unchanged (already closed by ADR-0010 in Unit 6.1).
  - **Q47** (repo Discussions enablement) — open; reaffirmed; documented the unblock sequence: repo-settings toggle → giscus.app config → `NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID` env on prod deploy → `GITHUB_TOKEN` in CI. Phase 6's 4 read surfaces all gracefully degrade without Q47 (Units 6.2 / 6.4 / 6.5 / 6.6).
  - **Q48** (talk-page indexing posture) — **partially-resolved**. The "linked from problem detail" half closed in Units 6.3 + 6.5 (with count upgrade). The sitemap half stays open — no sitemap surface exists at HEAD; tracked as a Phase-7+ hygiene candidate.
  - **Q49** (comment moderation routing) — **resolved** (closed by ADR-0010 D-F codifying the lean). The OPEN_QUESTIONS entry is now the cross-reference; ADR-0010 D-F is the locus.
- **ADR review (0001 – 0010)**: no drift introduced by Phase 6. ADR-0001 / 0002 / 0003 / 0004 / 0005 / 0006 / 0007 / 0008 / 0009 all held — Phase 6 added no Velite collections, no Zod schemas, no rating actions, no LLM calls, no drafts, no viz. ADR-0010 (new this phase) — Units 6.2 / 6.3 / 6.4 / 6.5 / 6.6 conform to the six D-A through D-F contracts; the env-safe wrappers added during Units 6.5 / 6.6 (`tryGetDiscussionByPath`, `tryGetRecentDiscussionActivity`) are mechanically faithful to D-D's fail-soft contract. No supersession needed.
- **Pre-Phase-6 questions untouched this phase**: Q2 / Q3 (DNS); Q6-Q11 / Q14-Q17 / Q19 (Phase-0/1); Q25 (JSON envelope); Q26 / Q28-Q31 (Phase-1/2; Q31 Velite+Zod-4 incompat still in `velite.config.ts` — Phase 6 added no new collections); Q33 (RSS `dc:creator`, coupled to Q2); Q37 (issue-template form-fields, Phase-4 deferred). decided-as-lean set Q34-Q36 / Q38-Q39 / Q42 / Q44 — none touched.
- **Cross-phase invariants reconfirmed at HEAD `e1be7e1`**:
  - First Load JS shared chunk = **103 kB** through every Phase-6 unit (verified at Units 6.2 / 6.3 / 6.4 / 6.5 / 6.6 build smokes).
  - Test count = **323/323 across 38 files** (Phase-6 +39 tests vs. Phase-5 close baseline of 284).
  - Route count = **333 prerendered pages** (Phase-6 +10 from Unit 6.3's talk pages; Phase-5 close was 322; Unit 5.13b added 1; 322 + 1 + 10 = 333 ✓).
  - `pnpm audit-content` = 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline since Phase 2; unchanged).
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings; typecheck / test / build untouched (docs-only).
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/6.9-open-questions-adr-review.md`.

#### Unit 6.10 — Phase 6 acceptance gate (Discussions thread)

- **★ Phase-6 closing unit**. Mirrors Unit 1.12 / 2.13 / 3.13 / 4.13 / 5.13. Verifies every §13 Phase-6+ thread-deliverable that this phase pulled (the **Discussions** thread per Unit 6.0 D-1) is operational locally at HEAD. The other §13 threads (auth, bilingual, subscriber list, monetization) remain available for future open-ended phases.
- **§13 Discussions thread — local pass status (all ✓)**:
  - GitHub Discussions read-side metadata client (`lib/discussions/github-graphql.ts`) — Unit 6.2.
  - `/problems/[slug]/talk` SSG route shell (10 pages) — Unit 6.3.
  - Giscus iframe embed wrapper — Unit 6.4.
  - Activity badge on problem cards + Discuss-link count upgrade — Unit 6.5.
  - Discussion threads in per-domain RSS digest — Unit 6.6.
  - `/talk` LHCI enrolment — Unit 6.7.
- **§14 universal cross-phase contract**: Lighthouse enrolment (`/problems/<slug>/talk`) ✓; W3C validator for digest endpoints deferred (Q27-class follow-on, gated on Q47 + first deploy); visual-regression baselines deferred (no Playwright spec changes); no auto-merge (Discussions are community-authored via Giscus iframe, never LLM-drafted); file-first / no DB held (build-time `.github-cache/` sidecar; no first-party identity storage); First Load JS shared chunk = 103 kB held throughout.
- **State at HEAD `23b3ee3`** (pre-this-commit; this unit is docs-only):
  - 10 problems / 5 domains / ~12 subdomains / 30 papers / 126 authors / 14 institutions / 20 rating actions / 4 issue templates / 1 methodology MDX / **2 contributing MDX** (v1.0 + v1.1) / 2 entries.json files. **Content unchanged this phase** — Phase 6 added code + scripts + docs.
  - New Phase-6 surfaces: 10 talk-page SSG routes; 1 GitHub GraphQL read-side client; 1 Giscus iframe wrapper; activity badge + count upgrade on problem cards and detail page; `kind: "discussion"` items in the per-domain RSS digests.
  - **333 prerendered pages** (322 at Phase-5 close + 1 from Unit 5.13b `/contributing/v1.1.0` + 10 from Unit 6.3 talk pages = 333 ✓).
  - **First Load JS shared chunk = 103 kB UNCHANGED** through every Phase-6 unit. `/problems/[slug]/talk` route-specific chunk = 108 kB First Load (103 + 2 kB Giscus wrapper, per ADR-0010 D-A bundle isolation).
  - **323/323 vitest tests across 38 files** (was 284/36 at Phase-5 close; **+39 tests this phase**: `github-graphql` 26 + `GiscusEmbed` 7 + `build-digest` discussion-flow +6).
  - `pnpm validate-content` → 203 files green. `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline since Phase 2). `pnpm typecheck` clean. `pnpm build` clean compile.
  - 5 visualizations live (unchanged from Phase 4).
  - **10 ADRs** (added ADR-0010 in Phase 6); 0001-0009 unchanged.
  - 2 new Phase-6 dependencies: `@octokit/graphql@^9.0.3`, `@giscus/react@^3.1.0`.
  - `lighthouserc.json` enrols **14 URLs** (was 13 at Phase-5 close; +1 for `/problems/hallucination-reduction/talk` in Unit 6.7).
  - OPEN_QUESTIONS: 4 new Phase-6 (Q46-Q49). Q46 + Q49 closed (both via ADR-0010); Q47 open operational; Q48 partially-resolved.
- **Phase-6 unit summary (11 units, 6.0 – 6.10)**: 6.0 prep (`ada448b`) → 6.1 ADR-0010 (`300cde3`) → 6.2 GraphQL client (`93230a1`) → 6.3 talk-page route (`f0dbff1`) → 6.4 Giscus embed (`f9a465e`) → 6.5 card badge + detail link (`d7f17f7`) → 6.6 digest extension (`0ac77e0`) → 6.7 LHCI enrolment (`d2c635e`) → 6.8 hygiene status (`e1be7e1`) → 6.9 OPEN_QUESTIONS + ADR review (`23b3ee3`) → 6.10 _this_.
- **Phase-6 follow-ons that survive the gate** (non-blocking): Q47 operational unblock sequence (repo-settings → giscus.app → env → CI token); W3C feed validator pass with discussion items (compound gate); `/problems/<slug>/talk` Playwright visual baselines; real-API integration smoke for Unit 6.2's GraphQL client; first LHCI run for the new URL; `app/sitemap.ts` + Q48 sitemap-half closure (Phase 7+).
- **Pre-existing follow-ons** (carryover from prior phases): orphan `components/domain-tile-grid/` deletion (curator authorization); `entries.json` backfill on 8 problems (editorial + API); `<managingEditor>` on RSS (Q2 DNS); W3C validator passes for Phase-3 + Phase-5 RSS (first deploy); `pnpm clean-drafts` script (operational signal); Phase-2 ROR-ID + InstaDeep orphan.
- **Phase 7 entry conditions**: per §12 cardinal rule, **explicit human sign-off required**. §13 Phase 6+ scope is open-ended; remaining threads = auth (DB-trigger flip MANDATORY on first write-path unit per Units 4.12 / 5.10 / 6.0 D-2) / bilingual (FR primary, pure content-side) / subscriber list (Phase-5 D-4 punt completion) / monetization. DB-migration trigger re-eval mandatory at Phase 7 kickoff; currently 1.434% of 5 MB.
- **Cross-phase milestone**: this commit closes the **Discussions thread** of Phase 6 in its entirety. The 11-unit breakdown shipped end-to-end with one structural refactor (Unit 6.5's sync/async split documented at the time). 8 commits + 1 ADR + 4 OPEN_QUESTIONS items + 2 new dependencies + 0 client-bundle regressions + 0 test regressions.

### Phase 7 — Community-adjacent surfaces (first thread: Bilingual rendering)

#### Unit 7.0 — Phase 7 prep (THINK doc + 12-unit Bilingual-thread breakdown + DB-migration trigger re-eval)

- Phase 7 kickoff per §12 cardinal rule. Phase 6 closed at HEAD `bb8f816` (Unit 6.10 Discussions-thread acceptance gate). **Phase 7 sign-off granted via "Continue" override** in the unit-rhythm rhythm (same precedent as Phase 5 → Phase 6 in Unit 6.0; §12 normally requires explicit sign-off — this unit flags the override transparently). Docs-only unit.
- **§13 ledger progress**: Discussions thread CLOSED (Phase 6); **Bilingual thread STARTED (Phase 7)**; auth + subscriber-list + monetization threads remain available for future open-ended phases.
- **D-1. First-thread recommendation = Bilingual rendering (FR primary)**. Rationale: lowest blast radius (no first-party auth; no DB-trigger flip; no Phase-4 "no user accounts" pact break); independent of every Phase-6 operational gate (Q47 / GITHUB_TOKEN / GISCUS_REPO_ID); matches the Montréal location signal explicitly mentioned in §13; symmetric to Phase 6's low-blast-radius first-thread choice; sequential thread-closure makes the §13 ledger easier to reason about; scope manageable (infrastructure + FR pilot in 12 units; content backfill is curator-track in parallel).
- **Alternative threads** enumerated with deferral rationale (overridable if redirected): auth (DB-trigger flip MANDATORY on first write-path; 14+ unit phase; commits provider; breaks "no user accounts" pact); subscriber-list (still coupled to auth or third-party; Phase-8 follow-on candidate); monetization (still premature without auth + API maturity).
- **12-unit breakdown** (7.0 – 7.11):
  - 7.0 Phase 7 prep (this doc) — docs.
  - 7.1 ADR-0011 — i18n strategy (`next-intl` + sub-path routing + sibling-file content storage + locale-toggle UI placement) — docs (ADR).
  - 7.2 `lib/i18n/` runtime + `next.config.ts` locale list + `middleware.ts` locale detection — code.
  - 7.3 App Router locale segment restructure — code.
  - 7.4 `/methodology` FR pilot translation + bilingual render — code + content.
  - 7.5 Velite collection extensions — sibling-file pattern (`*.fr.{mdx,yaml}`) + translation-source schema — code.
  - 7.6 `components/locale-toggle/` site-header UI — code.
  - 7.7 `lighthouserc.json` enrolment for FR pilot URL — code.
  - 7.8 `app/sitemap.ts` + Q48 sitemap-half closure (Phase-6 carryover absorbed) — code.
  - 7.9 Phase-7 hygiene status pass — docs.
  - 7.10 OPEN_QUESTIONS hygiene + ADR review — docs.
  - 7.11 Phase 7 acceptance gate — gate.
- **D-2. DB-migration trigger re-eval** (MANDATORY at Phase 7 kickoff per Units 4.12 / 5.10 / 6.0). Measured at HEAD `bb8f816`: `tar -czf .velite/ = 75,128 bytes (~73.4 KB) = ~1.433% of 5 MB threshold` (was 1.434% at Phase 6 kickoff; -0.001 pp delta is Velite MDX-compile jitter — Phase 6 added no new collections). Auth trigger negative under Bilingual-first. **Decision**: DB migration deferred to Phase 8+ OR Phase 7.X mid-phase if redirected to auth. Same conclusion as Units 4.12 / 5.10 / 6.0. **NEW WEIGHT** under Bilingual: FR content backfill is the primary content-scale driver in Phase 7+; if all problem.yaml + paper.yaml + MDX backfill into FR, file count ~doubles (203 → ~400), still under the `> 600` trigger. Watch as backfill progresses.
- **Decisions resolved in this unit**: D-1 (first-thread = Bilingual + rationale + alternatives table), D-2 (DB trigger 1.433% — deferred), D-3 (`next-intl` + sub-path routing lean), D-4 (sibling-file content storage lean), D-5 (`/methodology` as FR pilot target), D-6 (site-header locale-toggle UI position).
- **Decisions deferred** (D-7 through D-12): `next-intl` version pin (Unit 7.2); translation lookup format (JSON-per-locale; Unit 7.2); locale fallback chain (`fr` falls back to `en`; Unit 7.2); Velite glob extension (`*.fr.{yaml,mdx}`; Unit 7.5); URL slug strategy (English-canonical; Unit 7.3); SEO `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="...">` (Unit 7.4).
- **Newly surfaced open questions** (Q50-Q53):
  - **Q50** (i18n runtime choice) — decided-as-lean (`next-intl` + sub-path + JSON-per-locale; pinned in ADR-0011 at Unit 7.1).
  - **Q51** (bilingual content backfill cadence) — decided-as-lean (infrastructure ships in Phase 7; content backfill is curator-track in parallel).
  - **Q52** (translation provenance schema) — decided-as-lean (`translation_source: "human" | "machine-assisted"` frontmatter; default "human"; Unit 7.5).
  - **Q53** (curator authorship attribution per-locale) — decided-as-lean (stays global; translation provenance is separate from authorship; Unit 7.5).
- **Forward-looking DB-migration re-eval triggers** (carried from Unit 6.0): content scale 3× / `> 600` files / `> 1 MB` gzipped; first Phase-7+ write-path lands (auth flips) — stays cold throughout Phase 7; Phase 8 kickoff (mandatory); rating-action volume reaches 200; drafts-dir > 100 stale.
- **Order rationale**: 7.1 first (ADR gates code); 7.2 → 7.3 sequential (runtime → route restructure); 7.4 / 7.5 concurrent; 7.6 parallel-able; 7.7 / 7.8 late (LHCI + sitemap after pilot route stabilizes); 7.9 / 7.10 hygiene; 7.11 closes.
- **Parallel-curator awareness**: docs-only, no collision risk. Note for subsequent units: **Unit 7.3** (route restructure) touches every route file → highest collision risk; a parallel session overlapping with 7.3 would need to yield.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline since Phase 2); typecheck / test / build untouched since no source files modified.
- THINK artifact: `docs/thinking/7.0-phase-7-prep.md`.

#### Unit 7.1 — ADR-0011 (i18n strategy: next-intl + sub-path routing + sibling-file content storage)

- First ADR of Phase 7. Pins the leans surfaced in Unit 7.0 D-3 / D-4 / D-5 / D-6 into a firm decision before any code lands. Mirrors the ADR-0008 (LLM provider) precedent — first ADR of a phase that introduces a new third-party runtime surface lands BEFORE the runtime install (Unit 7.2). Docs-only.
- **ADR-0011 D-A through D-G**:
  - **D-A. Runtime = `next-intl`**. Pinned via `^3.x` in `dependencies`; `messages/<locale>.json` translation lookup format; ICU MessageFormat for plurals/interpolation. Other i18n runtimes forbidden until a follow-on ADR authorizes.
  - **D-B. URL routing = sub-path** (`/en/...`, `/fr/...`). Default locale = `en`; bare URLs 308-redirect to the defaulted locale. SSG-compatible; crawler-friendly; bookmarkable.
  - **D-C. Content-storage shape = sibling files**. EN files take no infix (preserves git history); translated files carry `.<locale>` infix before the extension (e.g. `problem.fr.yaml`, `background.fr.mdx`). Velite glob extension lands in Unit 7.5.
  - **D-D. Locale fallback chain = `fr → en` with switch hint**. Untranslated pages render the EN canonical content with a "this page is not yet translated" header hint. No partial-translation rendering. Hard-404 rejected (would break the Q51 "infrastructure ships in Phase 7; backfill is curator-track" decision).
  - **D-E. Slug strategy = English-canonical**. URL slugs do NOT translate. `/fr/problems/hallucination-reduction` is the correct French URL. Titles + body translate; slugs are stable technical identifiers. Per-locale slug aliases deferred to a future ADR.
  - **D-F. Locale-toggle UI = site-header**. Next to `ThemeToggle` in `components/site-header/`; `"use client"`; pre-hydration placeholder; click cycles through locales. Persists via URL (no cookie needed for state; cookie used only for first-visit Accept-Language hint).
  - **D-G. Translation provenance = `translation_source` frontmatter** on translated files. Values: `"human"` (default; curator-authored) or `"machine-assisted"` (curator-reviewed LLM draft). Required on `*.<locale>.{yaml,mdx}`; absent on EN-canonical files. Schema lands in Unit 7.5. `editorial.primary_curator` stays global per Q53 (translation provenance ≠ authorship attribution).
- **Considered options** (7 in total per the ADR's options table): next-intl + sub-path + sibling (chosen); Paraglide.js + sub-path + sibling; native Next.js i18n + custom lookup; no-i18n / defer to Phase 8+; next-intl + cookie-based routing; next-intl + sub-tree mirror; next-intl + `lang:` frontmatter discriminator. Each option carries explicit Pros/Cons in the ADR per the README's "≥ 2 options with explicit Pros/Cons" rule.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**: App Router-canonical surface; mature SDK; SSG-compatible routing; sibling-file storage preserves curator workflow; reversibility via `lib/i18n/` thin wrapper.
  - **Negative**: `next-intl` adds ~30 KB to client bundle on i18n-aware pages (mitigated by 103 kB First Load JS budget headroom); every URL gets a locale prefix (no language-neutral canonical URL; 308 redirect from bare URLs); English-canonical slugs create a French-speaker friction surface (slugs in English; titles in French); sibling-file pattern is curator-side slightly awkward when one problem has many MDX surfaces.
- **OPEN_QUESTIONS status changes**:
  - **Q50** (i18n runtime choice): decided-as-lean → **decided** (closed by ADR-0011 D-A + D-B).
  - **Q51 / Q52 / Q53**: stay decided-as-lean (the ADR codifies their working positions at the ADR level; per-unit implementation details land in Units 7.2 / 7.5).
- **ADR index update**: `docs/adr/README.md` extends to 11 entries; closing-paragraph note appended ("ADR-0011 was authored in Unit 7.1 (closes OPEN_QUESTIONS Q50 + codifies Q51-Q53 leans; accepted 2026-05-16)"); next ADR will be numbered 0012.
- **No code touched**: this is an ADR-only docs unit. `next-intl` install + lib/i18n runtime arrive at Unit 7.2.
- Smoke gates: `pnpm audit-content` → 0 errors / 6 warnings (Q32 baseline since Phase 2); typecheck / test / build untouched since no source files modified.
